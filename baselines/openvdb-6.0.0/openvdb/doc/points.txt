@section secPtOverview Introduction
@anchor openvdbPointsOverview

The @b OpenVDB library can store point data within an OpenVDB hierarchy in two
different ways. A @b PointIndexGrid stores index offsets that reference data
stored in an external linear point array, a @b PointDataGrid stores the points
with attributes directly in the VDB Grid. This document focuses mainly on the
localised style of storage used by @b PointDataGrids. Using this storage
mechanism, points are spatially-organised into VDB voxels to provide faster
access and a greater opportunity for data compression compared with linear point
arrays.

See the @ref openvdbPointsHelloWorld "Cookbook" for code examples to get started
using @b OpenVDB @b Points.

@section secPtCompression Compression

A key motivation behind the library is to increase data compression and thus
reduce the memory and disk space requirements of the point set.

There are three types of compression used in this library to store point
attribute data - (1) @b value @b compression where the codec is selected
specifically based on the intent of the data, (2) @b uniform @b compression
where arrays of identical values can be collapsed down into a single value,
(3) @b stream @b compression where the Blosc stream compressor can be used to
pack and unpack streams of data using a fast, lossless compression codec.

Uniform and stream compression are offered in other applications, notably
Houdini, but with the case of stream compression, used only for disk storage.

Value compression is provided based on the principal that a good general-purpose
compression scheme will usually not be superior to one that is specifically
tuned to the range and intention of how the data will be used. The most commonly
used style of value compression in OpenVDB Points is quantization for point
position data. Floating-point world-space positions will typically use a much
higher accuracy than desired around the origin and a much lower accuracy than
desired far from the origin, which is as a result of the dynamic range used in
floating-point that makes it usable at different orders of magnitude. More
tailored position compression is introduced by splitting positions into an
integer offset provided by the VDB voxels and grid transform and a reduced
precision fixed-point offset from the center of the voxel.

In addition, other attributes such as velocity can benefit from value
compression. For example, a unit vector scheme can compress a 3 x float vector
(12 bytes) into just 2 bytes.

@section secPtLocality Locality

Data compression isn't the only area to benefit from a spatially organised data
set. Due to the effects of L1 and L2 caching in modern CPUs, improved cache
locality through storing point data close in memory to their neighbors can bring
about a big improvement in performance.

A number of point rasterization gather-style tests that compared spatially
organised data with randomly organised linear data when dereferenced using a
spatial acceleration structure consistently resulted in a performance
improvement of between 2x and 3x.

@section secPtAttributes Attributes

Attribute storage is provided as an independent toolset within the library to
allow for use outside of OpenVDB grids.

@subsection secPtTypedAttributeArray TypedAttributeArray

The TypedAttributeArray stores array data with a specified value type and
compression codec, which form the template signature.

@code
template<typename ValueType, typename Codec>
class TypedAttributeArray: public AttributeArray
@endcode

The base AttributeArray class from which the TypedAttributeArray derives is not
templated and can be used for all non-typed operations such as serialization.

Here is an example of floating-point scalar attribute storage using a truncation
codec to reduce the footprint from 32-bit to 16-bit:

@code
openvdb::points::TypedAttributeArray<float, openvdb::points::TruncateCodec>
@endcode

@subsection secPtAttributeHandle AttributeHandle

AttributeHandle and AttributeWriteHandle classes provide access to the array
data without requiring knowledge of the codec. This is important as it can allow
users to add their own attribute compression schemes without requiring any
modification to existing code.

AttributeHandles provide benefits to memory usage in allowing data to be packed
and unpacked efficiently when using stream compression. When compressed with a
stream compression scheme, the AttributeHandle unpacks attribute data into a
local (uncompressed) buffer on access and discards this temporary data once the
AttributeHandle is destroyed. This has the benefit of retaining the stream
compression during access which lowers the peak memory substantially.

This is how to create a float AttributeHandle bound to a specific attribute in
a leaf:

@code
auto handle = AttributeHandle<float>::create(leaf->constAttributeArray("attribute_name"));
@endcode

Note that ensuring const access to the attribute array will prevent redundant
copying when using a read-only handle.

@subsection secPtAttributePerformance TypedAttributeArray vs AttributeHandle

One key benefit of AttributeHandles is that they ensure the data being accessed
has been uncompressed and is in-core on creation of the handle to avoid the need
to perform these checks when the data is being accessed and modified for
improved performance. An AttributeHandle may also be provided a specific codec
if known to eliminate the indirection cost.

@subsection secPtAttributeSet AttributeSet and Descriptor

The AttributeSet stores a collection of attribute arrays along with a Descriptor
that tracks the type of each of the attribute arrays.

In typical use cases, the Descriptor is shared amongst leaf nodes with many of
the algorithms making this assumption for performance reasons. However, it is
still possible to configure the data so that leaf nodes in the same grid can use
different Descriptors with different numbers and types of attributes. A typical
use-case for this might be to reduce precision of an attribute further from a
camera where accuracy is deemed less important and can be traded for a reduced
memory or disk footprint.

@section secPtPointTree The Point Tree

@subsection secPtPointIndexTree Point Index Tree

As mentioned in the introduction, the PointIndexTree is a structure in OpenVDB
that stores an array of offset indices to a linear point array in the leaf
nodes. In constrast, the PointDataTree stores the actual data localised in the
leaf nodes.

The PointIndexTree has this tree configuration:

@code
typedef tree::Tree4<PointIdx32, 5, 4, 3>::Type PointIndexTree;
@endcode

@subsection secPtPointDataTree Point Data Tree

The PointDataTree has this tree configuration:

@code
typedef tree::Tree4<PointDataIdx32, 5, 4, 3>::Type PointDataTree;
@endcode

Note that with both the PointIndexTree and the PointDataTree, the data type is
actually a 32-bit unsigned integer, but it is provided in this form to
distinguish it from other LeafNodes that store the same data type. None of the
other components within the Tree or Grid hierarchy change. It is for this reason
that many of the existing features of OpenVDB such as serialization work without
requiring additional functionality in OpenVDB.

@section secPtSparsity Voxel Values

For the PointDataTree, the voxel values represent the end position in the linear
attribute arrays attached to each LeafNode. Using the value of the previous
voxel (zero for the first voxel), the offset for the start position can be
deduced.

@subsection secPtBackground Background and Tile Values

There are three distinct ways of storing data in an OpenVDB tree:
<B>voxel values</B>, <B>tile values</B>, and a <B>background value</B>.
Unfortunately the background value and tile values make little sense for point
data. While technically it would be valid to use a non-zero background value and
tile value, this would simply mean that only the first voxel in the LeafNode
contains points which is neither an efficient storage mechanism nor particularly
common. For this reason, the LeafNode constructor may take a background value
but it is internally overriden to be zero on construction.

@subsection secPtActiveValues Active Values

Any voxel or tile can be classified as either @b active or @b inactive. The
interpretation of this state is application-specific, however there are some
conventions, such as using the active state to denote the narrow band in a
levelset. For points, the most intuitive use of the active state is to mark a
voxel as active if it contains points and inactive otherwise. This allows
iteration over the points in a LeafNode to be accelerated to only iterate over
voxels that contain points.

@subsection secPtIndexIterators Index Iterators
@anchor openvdbPointsIterators

An index iterator contains a value iterator and an index filter, however the
most common usage is provided by the convenience methods on the leaf node:

@code
auto iterAll = leaf.beginIndexAll();
auto iterOn = leaf.beginIndexOn();
auto iterOff = leaf.beginIndexOff();

for (; iterOn; ++iterOn) {
	Index32 index = *iterOn;
}
@endcode

These are analagous to the value iterators in the LeafNode and are creating an
index iterator that wraps the value iterator together with a null filter.

It is also possible to iterate over indices within a specific voxel by using the
beginIndexVoxel convenience method on the leaf:

@code
auto iterVoxel = leaf.beginIndexVoxel(ijk);
@endcode

For performance and simplicity, it is recommended to use the all/on/off index
iterators where possible, as these hide the explicit voxel iteration from the
user meaning it is only necessary to iterate over the indices within the leaf.
It is also possible to retrieve the voxel coordinate from the index iterator
directly.

@subsection secPtIndexFilters Index Filters

Index filters provide an easy way of only iterating over indices that match a
set criteria. One such index filter provided by the library is to iterate over
the points within a group:

@code
openvdb::points::GroupFilter filter("test_point_group");
auto iter = leaf.beginIndexOn(filter);
@endcode

As the index iterator is templated on the filter, it's possible to construct
filters that do relatively complicated operations provided they meet the basic
interface requirements of an IndexFilter.

@section secPtSpaceAndTrans Voxel Space, Index Space, World Space

Points are stored in @b voxel @b space, meaning all point positions lie between
(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5) and (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) with the center of the voxel being
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0). The position of the point can be extracted in @b index @b space
by adding the voxel space position to the ijk value of the voxel. The position
of the point can be extracted in @b world @b space by using the grid transform
to do an indexToWorld conversion.

See the @ref openvdbPointsHelloWorld "Cookbook" for code examples to get started
using @b OpenVDB @b Points.
