Versioning and releases
=======================

Pre-1.0 versioning
------------------

Taichi follows `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/>`_.

Since Taichi is still under version 1.0.0,
we use minor version bumps (e.g., ``0.6.17->0.7.0``) for breaking API changes,
and patch version bumps (e.g., ``0.6.9->0.6.10``) for backward-compatible changes.

Workflow: releasing a new version
---------------------------------

 - Trigger a Linux build on `Jenkins <http://f11.csail.mit.edu:8080/job/taichi/>`_ to see if CUDA passes all tests.
   Note that Jenkins is the only build bot we have that tests CUDA. (This may take half an hour.)
 - Create a branch for the release PR, forking from the latest commit of the ``master`` branch.

    * Update Taichi version number at the beginning of ``CMakeLists.txt``. For example, change ``SET(TI_VERSION_PATCH 9)`` to ``SET(TI_VERSION_PATCH 10)``.
    * Rerun cmake so that ``docs/version`` gets updated.
    * commit with message "[release] vX.Y.Z", e.g. "[release] v0.6.10".
    * You should see two changes in this commit: one line in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and one line in ``docs/version``.
    * Execute ``ti changelog`` and save its outputs. You will need this later.

- Open a PR titled "[release] vX.Y.Z" with the branch and commit you just now created.

    * Use the ``ti changelog`` output you saved in the previous step as the content of the PR description.
    * Wait for all the checks and build bots to complete. (This step may take up to two hours).

- Squash and merge the PR.
- Trigger the Linux build on Jenkins, again, so that Linux packages are uploaded to PyPI.
- Wait for all build bots to finish. This step uploads PyPI packages for OS X and Windows. You may have to wait for up to two hours.
- Update the ``stable`` branch so that the head of that branch is your release commit on ``master``.

- Draft a new release `(here) <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/releases>`_:

    * The title should be "vX.Y.Z".
    * The tag should be "vX.Y.Z".
    * Target should be "recent commit" -> the release commit.
    * The release description should be copy-pasted from the release PR description.
    * Click the "Publish release" button.

Release cycle
-------------

Taichi releases new versions twice per week:

 - The first release happens on Wednesdays.
 - The second release happens on Saturdays.

Additional releases may happen if anything needs an urgent fix.
