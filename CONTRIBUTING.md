# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Taichi! Please check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/contributor_guide) for how to make a contribution.

All contributors are expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Developer installation

Taichi is developed mainly in C++17 and Python3. Please check out the [Developer Installation](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/dev_install) to build Taichi from source. Note that Taichi is LLVM-10.0.0 dependent and that we recommend installing [our pre-built LLVM libraries](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/dev_install#install-llvm) for your platform.

## Contribution opportunities

Issues marked with ["welcome contribution"](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22welcome+contribution%22) are great places for starters. You can quickly get an idea of the entire workflow and how to join the community.

**RFC**: We use the `RFC` (Request for Comments) mechanism to discuss and organize some of the more advanced and self-contained features. These are the projects that we would like to work on but still lack a concrete design or implementation roadmap for because of their complexity. We document these requests and the threaded proposals in the hope that we could provide the community with a good enough context and draw upon insights from the potentially passionate minds. You can find all the ongoing RFCs [here](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ARFC+), and you are also welcome to file new RFCs with us!
