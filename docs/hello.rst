Hello, world!
===============================================

We introduce the Taichi programming language through a very basic `fractal` example.

First of all, let's install Taichi via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Python 3.6+ needed
  python3 -m pip install taichi

Now you are ready to run the Taichi code below (``python3 fractal.py``) to compute a
`Julia set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set>`_:

.. image:: https://github.com/yuanming-hu/public_files/raw/master/graphics/taichi/fractal.gif

.. code-block:: python

    # fractal.py

    import taichi as ti

    ti.init(arch=ti.gpu)

    n = 320
    pixels = ti.var(dt=ti.f32, shape=(n * 2, n))


    @ti.func
    def complex_sqr(z):
        return ti.Vector([z[0]**2 - z[1]**2, z[1] * z[0] * 2])


    @ti.kernel
    def paint(t: ti.f32):
        for i, j in pixels:  # Parallized over all pixels
            c = ti.Vector([-0.8, ti.cos(t) * 0.2])
            z = ti.Vector([i / n - 1, j / n - 0.5]) * 2
            iterations = 0
            while z.norm() < 20 and iterations < 50:
                z = complex_sqr(z) + c
                iterations += 1
            pixels[i, j] = 1 - iterations * 0.02


    gui = ti.GUI("Julia Set", res=(n * 2, n))

    for i in range(1000000):
        paint(i * 0.03)
        gui.set_image(pixels)
        gui.show()

Let's dive into components of this simple Taichi program.

import taichi as ti
-------------------
Taichi is a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Python.
Heavy engineering has been done to make Taichi as easy to use as a Python package.

After minimal learning efforts, every Python programmer will be capable of writing Taichi programs,
You can also reuse the Python package management system, Python IDEs, and existing Python packages.

Portability
-----------

Taichi code can run on CPUs or GPUs. Initialize Taichi according to your hardware platform:

.. code-block:: python

  # Run on GPU, automatically detect backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.gpu)

  # Run on GPU, with the NVIDIA CUDA backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.cuda)
  # Run on GPU, with the OpenGL backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.opengl)
  # Run on GPU, with the Apple Metal backend, if you are on OS X
  ti.init(arch=ti.metal)

  # Run on CPU (default)
  ti.init(arch=ti.cpu)

.. note::
    Supported backends on different platforms:

    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | platform | CPU  | CUDA | OpenGL | Metal |
    +==========+======+======+========+=======+
    | Windows  | OK   | OK   | OK     | N/A   |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | Linux    | OK   | OK   | OK     | N/A   |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | Mac OS X | OK   | N/A  | N/A    | OK    |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+

    (OK: supported; N/A: not available)

    With ``arch=ti.gpu``, Taichi will try to run on CUDA.
    If CUDA is not supported on your machine, Taichi will fall back to Metal or OpenGL.
    If no GPU backend (CUDA, Metal, or OpenGL) is supported, Taichi will fall back to CPUs.

.. note::

  When using the CUDA backend on Windows systems or ARM devices (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson),
  Taichi will by default allocate 1 GB memory for tensor storage. You can override this by initializing with
  ``ti.init(arch=ti.cuda, device_memory_GB=3.4)`` to allocate ``3.4`` GB GPU memory, or
  ``ti.init(arch=ti.cuda, device_memory_fraction=0.3)`` to allocate ``30%`` of total available GPU memory.

  On other platforms Taichi will make use of its on-demand memory allocator to adaptively allocate memory.

(Sparse) tensors
----------------

Taichi is a data-oriented programming language, where dense or spatially-sparse tensors are first-class citizens.
See :ref:`sparse` for more details on sparse tensors.

In the code above, ``pixels = ti.var(dt=ti.f32, shape=(n * 2, n))`` allocates a 2D dense tensor named ``pixel`` of
size ``(640, 320)`` and element data type ``ti.f32`` (i.e. ``float`` in C).

Functions and kernels
---------------------

Computation happens within Taichi **kernels**. Kernel arguments must be type-hinted.
The language used in Taichi kernels and functions looks exactly like Python, yet the Taichi frontend compiler converts it
into a language that is **compiled, statically-typed, lexically-scoped, parallel, and differentiable**.

You can also define Taichi **functions** with ``ti.func``, which can be called and reused by kernels and other functions.

.. note::

  **Taichi-scope v.s. Python-scope**: everything decorated with ``ti.kernel`` and ``ti.func`` is in Taichi-scope, which will be compiled by the Taichi compiler.
  Code outside the Taichi-scopes is simply normal Python code.

.. warning::

  Taichi kernels must be called in the Python-scope. I.e., **nested kernels are not supported**.
  Nested functions are allowed. **Recursive functions are not supported for now**.

  Taichi functions can only be called in Taichi-scope.

For those who came from the world of CUDA, ``ti.func`` corresponds to ``__device__``, and ``ti.kernel`` corresponds to ``__global__``.


Parallel for-loops
------------------
For loops at the outermost scope in a Taichi kernel is **automatically parallelized**.
For loops can have two forms, i.e. `range-for loops` and `struct-for loops`.

**Range-for loops** are no different from Python for loops, except that it will be parallelized
when used at the outermost scope. Range-for loops can be nested.

.. code-block:: python

  @ti.kernel
  def fill():
      for i in range(10): # Parallelized
          x[i] += i

          s = 0
          for j in range(5): # Serialized in each parallel thread
              s += j

          y[i] = s

  @ti.kernel
  def fill_3d():
      # Parallelized for all 3 <= i < 8, 1 <= j < 6, 0 <= k < 9
      for i, j, k in ti.ndrange((3, 8), (1, 6), 9):
          x[i, j, k] = i + j + k

.. note::

    It is the loop **at the outermost scope** that gets parallelized, not the outermost loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        @ti.kernel
        def foo():
            for i in range(10): # Parallelized :-)
                ...

        @ti.kernel
        def bar(k: ti.i32):
            if k > 42:
                for i in range(10): # Serial :-(
                    ...

**Struct-for loops** have are particularly useful when iterating over (sparse) tensor elements.
In the code above, ``for i, j in pixels`` loops over all the pixel coordinates, i.e. ``(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), ... , (0, 319), (1, 0), ..., (639, 319)``.

.. note::

    Struct-for is the key to :ref:`sparse` in Taichi, as it will only loop over active elements in a sparse tensor. In dense tensors, all elements are active.

.. warning::

    Struct-for's must live at the outer-most scope of kernels.

    It is the loop **at the outermost scope** that gets parallelized, not the outermost loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        @ti.kernel
        def foo():
            for i in x:
                ...

        @ti.kernel
        def bar(k: ti.i32):
            # The outermost scope is a `if` statement
            if k > 42:
                for i in x: # Not allowed. Struct-fors must live in the outermost scope.
                    ...




.. warning::

    ``break`` **is not supported in parallel loops**:

    .. code-block:: python

      @ti.kernel
      def foo():
        for i in x:
            ...
            break # Error!

        for i in range(10):
            ...
            break # Error!

      @ti.kernel
      def foo():
        for i in x:
            for j in range(10):
                ...
                break # OK!


Interacting with Python
------------------------

Everything outside Taichi-scopes (``ti.func`` and ``ti.kernel``) is simply Python. You can use your favorite Python packages (e.g. ``numpy``, ``pytorch``, ``matplotlib``) with Taichi.

In Python-scope, you can access Taichi tensors using plain indexing syntax, and helper functions such as ``from_numpy`` and ``to_torch``:

.. code-block:: python

  image[42, 11] = 0.7
  print(image[1, 63])

  import numpy as np
  pixels.from_numpy(np.random.rand(n * 2, n))

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.imshow(pixels.to_numpy())
  plt.show()
