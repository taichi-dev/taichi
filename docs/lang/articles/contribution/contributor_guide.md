## How to contribute bug fixes and new features

Issues marked with ["good first
issue"](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are great chances for starters.

- Please first leave a note (e.g. _I know how to fix this and would
  like to help!_) on the issue, so that people know someone is already
  working on it. This helps prevent redundant work;
- If no core developer has commented and described a potential
  solution on the issue, please briefly describe your plan, and wait
  for a core developer to reply before you start. This helps keep
  implementations simple and effective.

Issues marked with ["welcome
contribution"](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22welcome+contribution%22)
are slightly more challenging but still friendly to beginners.

## High-level guidelines

- Be pragmatic: practically solving problems is our ultimate goal.
- No overkills: always use _easy_ solutions to solve easy problems, so
  that you have time and energy for real hard ones.
- Almost every design decision has pros and cons. A decision is
  *good* if its pros outweigh its cons. Always think about
  both sides.
- Debugging is hard. Changesets should be small so that sources of
  bugs can be easily pinpointed.
- Unit/integration tests are our friends.

:::note
"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies. _The first method is far more difficult_."
â€” [C.A.R. Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare)
:::

One thing to keep in mind is that, Taichi was originally born as an
academic research project. This usually means that some parts did not
have the luxury to go through a solid design. While we are always trying
to improve the code quality, it doesn't mean that the project is free
from technical debts. Some places may be confusing or overly
complicated. Whenever you spot one, you are more than welcome to shoot
us a PR! :-)

## Effective communication

A few tips for effective communication in the Taichi community:

- How much information one effectively conveys, is way more important
  than how many words one typed.
- Be constructive. Be polite. Be organized. Be concise.
- Bulleted lists are our friends.
- Proofread before you post: if you are the reader, can you understand
  what you typed?
- If you are not a native speaker, consider using a spell checker such
  as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/).

Please base your discussion and feedback on facts, and not personal
feelings. It is very important for all of us to maintain a friendly and
blame-free community. Some examples:

:::tip Acceptable :-)
This design could be confusing to new Taichi users.

:::danger Not Acceptable
This design is terrible.

## Making good pull requests

- PRs with **small** changesets are preferred. A PR should ideally
  address **only one issue**.
  - It is fine to include off-topic **trivial** refactoring such as
    typo fixes;
  - The reviewers reserve the right to ask PR authors to remove
    off-topic **non-trivial** changes.
- All commits in a PR will always be **squashed and merged into master
  as a single commit**.
- PR authors **should not squash commits on their own**;
- When implementing a complex feature, consider breaking it down into
  small PRs, to keep a more detailed development history and to
  interact with core developers more frequently.
- If you want early feedback from core developers
  - Open a PR in
    [Draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
    state on GitHub so that you can share your progress;
  - Make sure you @ the corresponding developer in the comments or
    request the review.
- If you are making multiple PRs
  - Independent PRs should be based on **different** branches
    forking from `master`;
  - PRs with dependencies should be raised only after all
    prerequisite PRs are merged into `master`.
- All PRs should ideally come with corresponding **tests**;
- All PRs should come with **documentation updates**, except for
  internal compiler implementations;
- All PRs must pass **continuous integration tests** before they get
  merged;
- PR titles should follow [PR tag rules](./contributor_guide#pr-title-format-and-tags);
- A great article from Google on [how to have your PR merged
  quickly](https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/06/code-health-too-many-comments-on-your.html).
  [\[PDF\]](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/public_files/blob/master/graphics/taichi/google_review_comments.pdf)

## Reviewing & PR merging

- Please try to follow these tips from Google
  - [Code Health: Understanding Code In
    Review](https://testing.googleblog.com/2018/05/code-health-understanding-code-in-review.html);
    [\[PDF\]](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/public_files/blob/master/graphics/taichi/google_understanding_code.pdf)
  - [Code Health: Respectful Reviews == Useful
    Reviews](https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/11/code-health-respectful-reviews-useful.html).
    [\[PDF\]](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/public_files/blob/master/graphics/taichi/google_respectful_reviews.pdf)
- The merger should always **squash and merge** PRs into the master
  branch;
- The master branch is required to have a **linear history**;
- Make sure the PR passes **continuous integration tests**, except for
  cases like documentation updates;
- Make sure the title follows [PR tag rules](./contributor_guide#pr-title-format-and-tags).

## Using continuous integration

- Continuous Integration (CI) will **build** and **test** your
  commits in a PR in multiple environments.
- Currently, Taichi uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  (for OS X and Linux) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) (for Windows).
- CI will be triggered every time you push commits to an open PR.
- You can prepend `[skip ci]` to your commit message to avoid
  triggering CI. e.g. `[skip ci] This commit will not trigger CI`
- A tick on the right of commit hash means CI passed, a cross means CI
  failed.

## Enforcing code style

- Locally, you can run `ti format` in the command line to re-format
  code style. Note that you have to install `clang-format-6.0` and
  `yapf v0.29.0` locally before you use `ti format`.

- If you don't have these formatting tools locally, feel free to
  leverage GitHub actions: simply comment `\format` in a PR
  (e.g., [#2481](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/pull/2481#issuecomment-872226701))
  and then [Taichi Gardener](https://github.com/taichi-gardener)
  will automatically format the code for you.

## PR title format and tags

PR titles will be part of the commit history reflected in the `master`
branch, therefore it is important to keep PR titles readable.

- Please always prepend **at least one tag** such as `[Lang]` to PR
  titles:
  - When using multiple tags, make sure there is exactly one
    space between tags;
  - E.g., "[Lang][refactor]" (no space) should be replaced
    by "[Lang] [refactor]";
- The first letter of the PR title body should be capitalized:
  - E.g., `[Doc] improve documentation` should be replaced by
    `[Doc] Improve documentation`;
  - `[Lang] "ti.sqr(x)" is now deprecated` is fine because `"`
    is a symbol.
- Please do not include back quotes ("`") in PR titles.
- For example, "[Metal] Support bitmasked SNode", "[Vulkan]
  ti.atomic_min/max support", or "[Opt] [ir] Enhanced intra-function optimizations".

Frequently used tags:

- `[CPU]`, `[CUDA]`, `[Metal]`, `[Vulkan]`, `[OpenGL]`: backends;
- `[LLVM]`: the LLVM backend shared by CPUs and CUDA;
- `[Lang]`: frontend language features, including syntax sugars;
- `[Std]`: standard library, e.g. `ti.Matrix` and `ti.Vector`;
- `[Sparse]`: sparse computation;
- `[IR]`: intermediate representation;
- `[Opt]`: IR optimization passes;
- `[GUI]`: the built-in GUI system;
- `[Refactor]`: code refactoring;
- `[CLI]`: commandline interfaces, e.g. the `ti` command;
- `[Doc]`: documentation under `docs/`;
- `[Example]`: examples under `examples/`;
- `[Test]`: adding or improving tests under `tests/`;
- `[Linux]`: Linux platform;
- `[Mac]`: macOS platform;
- `[Windows]`: Windows platform;
- `[Perf]`: performance improvements;
- `[CI]`: CI/CD workflow;
- `[Misc]`: something that doesn't belong to any category, such as
  version bump, reformatting;
- `[Bug]`: bug fixes;
- Check out more tags in
  [misc/prtags.json](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/master/misc/prtags.json).
- When introducing a new tag, please update the list in
  `misc/prtags.json` in the first PR with that tag, so that people can
  follow.

:::note

We do appreciate all kinds of contributions, yet we should not expose
the title of every PR to end-users. Therefore the changelog will
distinguish *what the user should know* from *what the
developers are doing*. This is done by **capitalizing PR
tags**:

- PRs with visible/notable features to the users should be marked
  with tags starting with **the first letter capitalized**, e.g.
  `[Metal]`, `[Vulkan]`, `[IR]`, `[Lang]`, `[CLI]`. When releasing a new
  version, a script (`python/taichi/make_changelog.py`) will
  generate a changelog with these changes (PR title) highlighted.
  Therefore it is **important** to make sure the end-users can
  understand what your PR does, **based on your PR title**.
- Other PRs (underlying development/intermediate implementation)
  should use tags with **everything in lowercase letters**: e.g.
  `[metal]`, `[vulkan]`, `[ir]`, `[lang]`, `[cli]`.
- Because of the way the release changelog is generated, there
  should be **at most one capitalized tag** in a PR title to prevent
  duplicate PR highlights. For example,
  `[GUI] [Mac] Support modifier keys` ([#1189](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/pull/1189)) is a bad example, we
  should have used `[gui] [Mac] Support modifier keys in GUI` instead.
  Please capitalize the tag that is the *most* relevant to the PR.

## C++ and Python standards

The C++ part of Taichi is written in C++17, and the Python part in 3.6+.
You can assume that C++17 and Python 3.6 features are always available.

## Tips on the Taichi compiler development

[Life of a Taichi kernel](./compilation.md) may worth checking out. It
explains the whole compilation process.

See also [Benchmarking and regression tests](./utilities.md#benchmarking-and-regression-tests) if your work involves
IR optimization.

When creating a Taichi program using
`ti.init(arch=desired_arch, **kwargs)`, pass in the following parameters
to make the Taichi compiler print out IR:

- `print_preprocessed=True`: print results of the frontend Python
  AST transform. The resulting scripts will generate a Taichi Frontend
  AST when executed.
- `print_ir=True`: print the Taichi IR transformation process of
  kernel (excluding accessors) compilation.
- `print_accessor_ir=True`: print the IR transformation process of
  data accessors, which are special and simple kernels. (This is
  rarely used, unless you are debugging the compilation of data
  accessors.)
- `print_struct_llvm_ir=True`: save the emitted LLVM IR by Taichi
  struct compilers.
- `print_kernel_llvm_ir=True`: save the emitted LLVM IR by Taichi
  kernel compilers.
- `print_kernel_llvm_ir_optimized=True`: save the optimized LLVM IR
  of each kernel.
- `print_kernel_nvptx=True`: save the emitted NVPTX of each kernel
  (CUDA only).

:::note
Data accessors in Python-scope are implemented as special Taichi
kernels. For example, `x[1, 2, 3] = 3` will call the writing accessor
kernel of `x`, and `print(y[42])` will call the reading accessor kernel
of `y`.

```

## Testing

Tests should be added to `tests/`.

### Command-line tools

- Use `ti test` to run all the tests.
- Use `ti test -v` for verbose outputs.
- Use `ti test -C` to run tests and record code coverage, see
  [Code coverage](./utilities.md#coverage) for more information.
- Use `ti test -a <arch(s)>` for testing against specified backend(s).
  e.g. `ti test -a cuda,metal`.
- Use `ti test -na <arch(s)>` for testing all architectures excluding
  some of them. e.g. `ti test -na opengl,x64`.
- Use `ti test <filename(s)>` to run specific tests in filenames. e.g.
  `ti test numpy_io` will run all tests in
  `tests/python/test_numpy_io.py`.
- Use `ti test -c` to run only the C++ tests. e.g.
  `ti test -c alg_simp` will run `tests/cpp/test_alg_simp.cpp`.
- Use `ti test -k <key>` to run tests that match the specified key.
  e.g. `ti test linalg -k "cross or diag"` will run the `test_cross`
  and `test_diag` in `tests/python/test_linalg.py`.

For more options, see `ti test -h`.

For more details on how to write a test case, see
[Workflow for writing a Python test](./write_test.md).

## Documentation

Documentation source files are under the `docs/` folder of [**the main Taichi repo**](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi).
An automatic service syncs the updated content with our [documentation repo](https://github.com/taichi-dev/docs.taichi.graphics) and deploys the documentation at [the Taichi documentation site](https://docs.taichi.graphics).

We use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) (.md) to write documentation.
Please see [the documentation writing guide](./doc_writing) for more tips.

To set up a local server and preview your documentation edits in real time,
see instructions for [Local Development](https://github.com/taichi-dev/docs.taichi.graphics#local-development).

## Efficient code navigation across Python/C++

If you work on the language frontend (Python/C++ interface), to navigate
around the code base,
[ffi-navigator](https://github.com/tqchen/ffi-navigator) allows you to
jump from Python bindings to their definitions in C++, please follow their
README to set up your editor.

## Upgrading CUDA

Right now we are targeting CUDA 10. Since we use run-time loaded
[CUDA driver APIs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/index.html)
which are relatively stable across CUDA versions, a compiled Taichi binary
should work for all CUDA versions >= 10. When upgrading CUDA version, the
file `external/cuda_libdevice/slim_libdevice.10.bc` should also be
replaced with a newer version.

To generate the slimmed version of libdevice based on a full
`libdevice.X.bc` file from a CUDA installation, use:

```bash
ti task make_slim_libdevice [libdevice.X.bc file]
```
