Debugging
=========

Debugging a parallel program is not easy, so Taichi provides
builtin utilities that could hopefully help you debug your Taichi program.

Run-time ``print`` in kernels
-----------------------------

.. function:: print(arg1, ..., sep=' ', end='\n')

Debug your program with ``print()`` in Taichi-scope. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @ti.kernel
    def inside_taichi_scope():
        x = 233
        print('hello', x)
        #=> hello 233

        print('hello', x * 2 + 200)
        #=> hello 666

        print('hello', x, sep='')
        #=> hello233

        print('hello', x, sep='', end='')
        print('world', x, sep='')
        #=> hello233world233

        m = ti.Matrix([[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]])
        print('m =', m)
        #=> m = [[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]

        v = ti.Vector([3, 4])
        print('v =', v)
        #=> v = [3, 4]

For now, Taichi-scope ``print`` supports string, scalar, vector, and matrix expressions as arguments.
``print`` in Taichi-scope may be a little different from ``print`` in Python-scope. Please see details below.

.. warning::

    For the **CPU, CUDA, and Metal backend**, ``print`` will not work in Graphical Python Shells
    including IDLE and Jupyter notebook. This is because these backends print the outputs to the console instead of the GUI.
    Taichi developers are trying to solve this now. Use the **OpenGL backend** if you wish to
    use ``print`` in IDLE / Jupyter.

.. warning::

    Note that ``print`` in Taichi-scope can only receive **comma-separated parameter**. Neither f-string nor formatted string should be used. For example:
    .. code-block:: python
        import taichi as ti
        ti.init(arch=ti.cpu)
        a = ti.var(ti.f32, 4)


        @ti.kernel
        def foo():
            a[0] = 1.0
            print('a[0] = ', a[0]) # right
            print(f'a[0] = {a[0]}') # wrong, f-string is not supported
            print("a[0] = %f" % a[0]) # wrong, formatted string is not supported

        foo()
.. note::

    For the **OpenGL and CUDA backend**, the printed result will not show up until ``ti.sync()`` is called:

    .. code-block:: python

        import taichi as ti
        ti.init(arch=ti.cuda)

        @ti.kernel
        def kern():
            print('inside kernel')

        print('before kernel')
        kern()
        print('after kernel')
        ti.sync()
        print('after sync')

    obtains:

    .. code-block:: none

        before kernel
        after kernel
        inside kernel
        after

    Please note that host access or program end will also implicitly invoke ``ti.sync()``.


Compile-time ``ti.static_print``
--------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to print Python-scope objects and constants like data types or SNodes in Taichi-scope.
So, similar to ``ti.static`` we provide ``ti.static_print`` to print compile-time constants.
It is similar to Python-scope ``print``.

.. code-block:: python

    x = ti.var(ti.f32, (2, 3))
    y = 1

    @ti.kernel
    def inside_taichi_scope():
        ti.static_print(y)
        # => 1
        ti.static_print(x.shape)
        # => (2, 3)
        ti.static_print(x.dtype)
        # => DataType.float32
        for i in range(4):
                ti.static_print(i.dtype)
                # => DataType.int32
                # will only print once

Unlike ``print``, ``ti.static_print`` will only print the expression once at compile-time, and
therefore it has no runtime cost.


Runtime ``assert`` in kernel
----------------------------

Programmers may use ``assert`` statements in Taichi-scope. When the assertion condition failed, a
``RuntimeError`` will be raised to indicate the error.

To make ``assert`` work, first make sure you are using the **CPU backend**.
For performance reason, ``assert`` only works when ``debug`` mode is on, For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ti.init(arch=ti.cpu, debug=True)

    x = ti.var(ti.f32, 128)

    @ti.kernel
    def do_sqrt_all():
        for i in x:
            assert x[i] >= 0
            x[i] = ti.sqrt(x)


When you are done with debugging, simply set ``debug=False``. Now ``assert`` will be ignored
and there will be no runtime overhead.


Compile-time ``ti.static_assert``
---------------------------------

.. function:: ti.static_assert(cond, msg=None)

Like ``ti.static_print``, we also provide a static version of ``assert``:
``ti.static_assert``. It can be useful to make assertions on data types, dimensionality, and shapes.
It works whether ``debug=True`` is specified or not. When an assertion fails, it will
raise an ``AssertionError``, just like a Python-scope ``assert``.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @ti.func
    def copy(dst: ti.template(), src: ti.template()):
        ti.static_assert(dst.shape == src.shape, "copy() needs src and dst tensors to be same shape")
        for I in ti.grouped(src):
            dst[I] = src[I]
        return x % 2 == 1


Pretty Taichi-scope traceback
-----------------------------

As we all know, Python provides a useful stack traceback system, which could help you
locate the issue easily. But sometimes stack tracebacks from **Taichi-scope** could be
extremely complicated and hard to read. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import taichi as ti
    ti.init()

    @ti.func
    def func3():
        ti.static_assert(1 + 1 == 3)

    @ti.func
    def func2():
        func3()

    @ti.func
    def func1():
        func2()

    @ti.kernel
    def func0():
        func1()

    func0()

Running this code, of course, will result in an ``AssertionError``:

.. code-block:: none

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "misc/demo_excepthook.py", line 20, in <module>
        func0()
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 559, in wrapped
        return primal(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 488, in __call__
        self.materialize(key=key, args=args, arg_features=arg_features)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 367, in materialize
        taichi_kernel = taichi_kernel.define(taichi_ast_generator)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 364, in taichi_ast_generator
        compiled()
      File "misc/demo_excepthook.py", line 18, in func0
        func1()
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 39, in decorated
        return fun.__call__(*args)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 79, in __call__
        ret = self.compiled(*args)
      File "misc/demo_excepthook.py", line 14, in func1
        func2()
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 39, in decorated
        return fun.__call__(*args)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 79, in __call__
        ret = self.compiled(*args)
      File "misc/demo_excepthook.py", line 10, in func2
        func3()
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 39, in decorated
        return fun.__call__(*args)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/kernel.py", line 79, in __call__
        ret = self.compiled(*args)
      File "misc/demo_excepthook.py", line 6, in func3
        ti.static_assert(1 + 1 == 3)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/error.py", line 14, in wrapped
        return foo(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/root/taichi/python/taichi/lang/impl.py", line 252, in static_assert
        assert cond
    AssertionError

You may already feel brain fried by the annoying ``decorated``'s and ``__call__``'s.
These are the Taichi internal stack frames. They have almost no benefit for end-users
but make the traceback hard to read.

For this purpose, we may want to use ``ti.init(excepthook=True)``, which *hooks* on the
exception handler, and make the stack traceback from Taichi-scope easier to read and
intuitive. e.g.:


.. code-block:: python

    import taichi as ti
    ti.init(excepthook=True)  # just add this option!

    ...


And the result will be:

.. code-block:: none

    ========== Taichi Stack Traceback ==========
    In <module>() at misc/demo_excepthook.py:21:
    --------------------------------------------
    @ti.kernel
    def func0():
        func1()

    func0()  <--
    --------------------------------------------
    In func0() at misc/demo_excepthook.py:19:
    --------------------------------------------

    def func1():
        func2()  <--

    @ti.kernel
    --------------------------------------------
    In func2() at misc/demo_excepthook.py:11:
    --------------------------------------------
        ti.static_assert(1 + 1 == 3)

    @ti.func
    def func2():
        func3()  <--

    @ti.func
    --------------------------------------------
    In func3() at misc/demo_excepthook.py:7:
    --------------------------------------------
    ti.enable_excepthook()

    @ti.func
    def func3():
        ti.static_assert(1 + 1 == 3)  <--

    @ti.func
    --------------------------------------------
    AssertionError

See? Our exception hook has removed some useless Taichi internal frames from
traceback. What's more, although not visible in the doc, the output is
**colorful**!


.. note::

    For IPython / Jupyter notebook users, the IPython stack traceback hook
    will be overriden by the Taichi one when ``ti.enable_excepthook()``.


Debugging Tips
--------------

Debugging a Taichi program can be hard even with the builtin tools above.
Here we showcase some common bugs that one may encounter in a Taichi program.

Static type system
++++++++++++++++++

Python code in Taichi-scope is translated into a statically typed language for high performance. This means code in Taichi-scope can have a different behavior compared with that in Python-scope, especially when it comes to types.

The type of a variable is simply **determined at its initialization and never changes later**.

Although Taichi's static type system provides better performance, it may lead to bugs if
programmers carelessly used the wrong types. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    @ti.kernel
    def buggy():
        ret = 0  # 0 is an integer, so `ret` is typed as int32
        for i in range(3):
            ret += 0.1 * i  # i32 += f32, the result is still stored in int32!
        print(ret)  # will show 0

    buggy()

The code above shows a common bug due to Taichi's static type system.
The Taichi compiler should show a warning like:

.. code-block:: none

    [W 06/27/20 21:43:51.853] [type_check.cpp:visit@66] [$19] Atomic add (float32 to int32) may lose precision.

This means that Taichi cannot store a ``float32`` result precisely to ``int32``.
The solution is to initialize ``ret`` as a float-point value:

.. code-block:: python

    @ti.kernel
    def not_buggy():
        ret = 0.0  # 0 is a floating point number, so `ret` is typed as float32
        for i in range(3):
            ret += 0.1 * i  # f32 += f32. OK!
        print(ret)  # will show 0.6

    not_buggy()



Advanced Optimization
+++++++++++++++++++++

Taichi has an advanced optimization engine to make your Taichi kernel to be as fast as it could.
But like what ``gcc -O3`` does, advanced optimization may occasionally lead to bugs as it tries
too hard. This includes runtime errors such as:

```RuntimeError: [verify.cpp:basic_verify@40] stmt 8 cannot have operand 7.```

You may use ``ti.init(advance_optimization=False)`` to turn off advanced
optimization and see if the issue still exists:

.. code-block:: python

    import taichi as ti

    ti.init(advance_optimization=False)

    ...

Whether or not turning off optimization fixes the issue, please feel free to report this bug on `GitHub <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues/new?labels=potential+bug&template=bug_report.md>`_. Thank you!
