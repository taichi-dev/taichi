# Internal designs

## Intermediate representation (IR)

Taichi's computation IR is designed to be
- Static-single assignment;
- Hierarchical, instead of LLVM-style control-flow graph + basic blocks;
- Differentiable;
- Statically and strongly typed.

For example, a simple Taichi kernel
```python {4-8} title=show_ir.py
import taichi as ti
ti.init(print_ir=True)

@ti.kernel
def foo():
    for i in range(10):
        if i < 4:
            print(i)

foo()
```

may be compiled into

```
kernel {
  $0 = offloaded range_for(0, 10) grid_dim=0 block_dim=32
  body {
    <i32> $1 = loop $0 index 0
    <i32> $2 = const [4]
    <i32> $3 = cmp_lt $1 $2
    <i32> $4 = const [1]
    <i32> $5 = bit_and $3 $4
    $6 : if $5 {
      print $1, "\n"
    }
  }
}

```

:::note
Use `ti.init(print_ir=True)` to print IR of all instantiated kernels.

## Data structure organization

The internal organization of Taichi's data structure is defined using the **Structural Node**
("SNode", /snōd/) tree system. The SNode system might be confusing for new developers:
it is important to distinguish three concepts: SNode **containers**,
SNode **cells**, and SNode **components**.

- A SNode **container** can have multiple SNode **cells**. The numbers of
  **cells** are recommended to be powers of two.

  - For example, `S = ti.root.dense(ti.i, 128)` creates an SNode `S`, and each `S` container has `128` `S` cells.
- A SNode **cell** can have multiple SNode **components**.

  - For example, `P = S.dense(ti.i, 4); Q = S.dense(ti.i, 4)` inserts two components (one `P` container and one `Q` container) into each `S` cell.
- Note that each SNode **component** is a SNode **container** of a lower-level SNode.

A hierarchical data structure in Taichi, dense or sparse, is essentially a tree with interleaved container and cell levels.
Note that containers of `place` SNodes do not have cells. Instead, they
directly contain numerical values.

Consider the following example:

```python
# misc/listgen_demo.py

x = ti.field(ti.i32)
y = ti.field(ti.i32)
z = ti.field(ti.i32)

S0 = ti.root
S1 = S0.pointer(ti.i, 4)

S2 = S1.dense(ti.i, 2)
S2.place(x, y) # S3: x; S4: y

S5 = S1.dense(ti.i, 2)
S5.place(z) # S6: z
```

- The whole data structure is an `S0root` **container**, containing
  - 1x `S0root` **cell**, which has only one **component**, which
    is
    - An `S1pointer` **container**, containing
      - 4x `S1pointer` **cells**, each with two **components**,
        which are
        - An `S2dense` **container**, containing
          - 2x `S2dense` **cells**, each with two
            **components**, which are
            - An `S3place_x` container which directly
              contains a `x: ti.i32` value
            - An `S4place_y` container which directly
              contains a `y: ti.i32` value
        - An `S5dense` **container**, containing
          - 2x `S5dense` **cells**, each with one
            **component**, which is
            - An `S6place` container which directly
              contains a `z: ti.i32` value

The following figure shows the hierarchy of the data structure. The
numbers are `indices` of the containers and cells.

Note that the `S0root` container and cell do not have an `index`.

In summary, we will have the following containers:

- 1x `S0root` container
- 1x `S1pointer` container
- 4x `S2dense` containers
- 4x `S5dense` containers
- 8x `S3place_x` containers, each directly containing an `i32` value
- 8x `S4place_y` containers, each directly containing an `i32` value
- 8x `S6place_z` containers, each directly containing an `i32` value

... and the following cells:

- 1x `S0root` cell
- 4x `S1pointer` cells
- 8x `S2dense` cells
- 8x `S5dense` cells

Again, note that `S3place_x`, `S4place_y` and `S6place_z` containers do **not**
have corresponding cells.

In struct compilers of supported backends, each SNode has two types: `container` type and
`cell` type. Again, **components** of a higher level SNode **cell** are
**containers** of a lower level SNode.

Note that **cells** are never exposed to end-users.

**List generation** generates lists of SNode **containers** (instead of
SNode **cells**).

:::note
We are on our way to remove usages of **children**, **instances**, and
**elements** in Taichi. These are very ambiguous terms and should be replaced with standardized terms: **container**, **cell**, and **component**.
:::

## List generation

Struct-fors in Taichi loop over all active elements of a (sparse) data
structure **in parallel**. Evenly distributing work onto processor cores
is challenging on sparse data structures: naively splitting an irregular
tree into pieces can easily lead to partitions with drastically
different numbers of leaf elements.

Our strategy is to generate lists of active **SNode containers**, layer by
layer. The list generation computation happens on the same device as
normal computation kernels, depending on the `arch` argument when the
user calls `ti.init()`.

List generations flatten the data structure leaf elements into a 1D
list, circumventing the irregularity of incomplete trees. Then we
can simply invoke a regular **parallel for** over the 1D list.

For example,

```python {14-17}
# misc/listgen_demo.py

import taichi as ti

ti.init(print_ir=True)

x = ti.field(ti.i32)

S0 = ti.root
S1 = S0.dense(ti.i, 4)
S2 = S1.bitmasked(ti.i, 4)
S2.place(x)

@ti.kernel
def func():
    for i in x:
        print(i)

func()
```

gives you the following IR:

```
$0 = offloaded clear_list S1dense
$1 = offloaded listgen S0root->S1dense
$2 = offloaded clear_list S2bitmasked
$3 = offloaded listgen S1dense->S2bitmasked
$4 = offloaded struct_for(S2bitmasked) block_dim=0 {
  <i32 x1> $5 = loop index 0
  print i, $5
}
```

Note that `func` leads to two list generations:

- (Tasks `$0` and `$1`) based on the list of the (only) `S0root` container,
  generate the list of the (only) `S1dense` container;
- (Tasks `$2` and `$3`) based on the list of `S1dense` containers,
  generate the list of `S2bitmasked` containers.

The list of `S0root` SNode always has exactly one container, so we
never clear or re-generate this list. Although the list of `S1dense` always
has only one container, we still regenerate the list for uniformity.
The list of `S2bitmasked` has 4 containers.

:::note
The list of `place` (leaf) nodes (e.g., `S3` in this example) is never
generated. Instead, we simply loop over the list of their parent nodes,
and for each parent node we enumerate the `place` nodes on-the-fly
(without actually generating a list).

The motivation for this design is to amortize list generation overhead.
Generating one list element per leaf node (`place` SNode) element is too
expensive, likely much more expensive than the essential computation
happening on the leaf element. Therefore we only generate their parent
element list, so that the list generation cost is amortized over
multiple child elements of a second-to-last-level SNode element.

In the example above, although we have 16 instances of `x`, we only
generate a list of 4 x `S2bitmasked` nodes (and 1 x `S1dense` node).

## Statistics

In some cases, it is helpful to gather certain quantitative information
about internal events during Taichi program execution. The `Statistics`
class is designed for this purpose.

Usage:

```cpp
#include "taichi/util/statistics.h"

// add 1.0 to counter "codegen_offloaded_tasks"
taichi::stat.add("codegen_offloaded_tasks");

// add the number of statements in "ir" to counter "codegen_statements"
taichi::stat.add("codegen_statements", irpass::analysis::count_statements(this->ir));
```

Note the keys are `std::string` and values are `double`.

To print out all statistics in Python:

```python
ti.core.print_stat()
```

## Why Python frontend

Embedding Taichi in `python` has the following advantages:

- Easy to learn. Taichi has a very similar syntax to Python.
- Easy to run. No ahead-of-time compilation is needed.
- This design allows people to reuse existing python infrastructure:
  - IDEs. A python IDE mostly works for Taichi with syntax
    highlighting, syntax checking, and autocomplete.
  - Package manager (pip). A developed Taichi application and be
    easily submitted to `PyPI` and others can easily set it up with
    `pip`.
  - Existing packages. Interacting with other python components
    (e.g. `matplotlib` and `numpy`) is just trivial.
- The built-in AST manipulation tools in `python` allow us to flexibly
manipulate and analyze Python ASTs,
as long as the kernel body function is parse-able by the Python parser.

However, this design has drawbacks too:

- Taichi kernels must be parse-able by Python parsers. This means Taichi
  syntax cannot go beyond Python syntax.
  - For example, indexing is always needed when accessing elements
    in Taichi fields, even if the fields is 0D. Use `x[None] = 123`
    to set the value in `x` if `x` is 0D. This is because `x = 123`
    will set `x` itself (instead of its containing value) to be the
    constant `123` in Python syntax. For code consistency in Python-
    and Taichi-scope, we have to use the more verbose `x[None] = 123` syntax.
- Python has relatively low performance. This can cause a performance
  issue when initializing large Taichi fields with pure python
  scripts. A Taichi kernel should be used to initialize huge fields.

## Virtual indices v.s. physical indices

In Taichi, _virtual indices_ are used to locate elements in fields, and
_physical indices_ are used to specify data layouts in memory.

For example,

- In `a[i, j, k]`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are **virtual** indices.
- In `for i, j in x:`, `i` and `j` are **virtual** indices.
- `ti.i, ti.j, ti.k, ti.l, ...` are **physical** indices.
- In struct-for statements, `LoopIndexStmt::index` is a **physical**
  index.

The mapping between virtual indices and physical indices for each
`SNode` is stored in `SNode::physical_index_position`. I.e.,
`physical_index_position[i]` answers the question: **which physical
index does the i-th virtual index** correspond to?

Each `SNode` can have a different virtual-to-physical mapping.
`physical_index_position[i] == -1` means the `i`-th virtual index does
not corrspond to any physical index in this `SNode`.

`SNode` s in handy dense fields (i.e.,
`a = ti.field(ti.i32, shape=(128, 256, 512))`) have **trivial**
virtual-to-physical mapping, e.g. `physical_index_position[i] = i`.

However, more complex data layouts, such as column-major 2D fields can
lead to `SNodes` with `physical_index_position[0] = 1` and
`physical_index_position[1] = 0`.

```python
a = ti.field(ti.f32, shape=(128, 32, 8))

b = ti.field(ti.f32)
ti.root.dense(ti.j, 32).dense(ti.i, 16).place(b)

ti.get_runtime().materialize()

mapping_a = a.snode().physical_index_position()

assert mapping_a == {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}

mapping_b = b.snode().physical_index_position()

assert mapping_b == {0: 1, 1: 0}
# Note that b is column-major:
# the virtual first index exposed to the user comes second in memory layout.
```

Taichi supports up to 8 (`constexpr int taichi_max_num_indices = 8`)
virtual indices and physical indices.
