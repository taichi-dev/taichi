TaichiCon
=========

We are hosting a series of online **TaichiCon** events for developers to gather and share their Taichi experiences.

Past Conferences
----------------

Everything on previous TaichiCons is available in the `TaichiCon <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichicon>`_ repository.

Format
------

Each TaichiCon consists of two parts: **talks** and **free discussions**.

 - The first 1-hour consists of four 10-minute talks, each with 5-minute Q&A;

 - After the formal talks, attendees are free to chat about Taichi in any aspects.

The conference format may evolve in the future.

Language
--------

The ``i``-th TaichiCon will be hosted in

  - English ``(if i % 2 == 1)``;
  - Chinese (Mandarin) ``(if i % 2 == 0)``.

Time and frequency
------------------

Taichi developers are scattered around the world,
so it's important to pick a good time so that people in different time zones can attend.

A good time for people in Asia and the U.S.:

 - (China, Beijing) Sunday 10:00 - 11:00
 - (Japan, Tokyo) Sunday 11:00 - 12:00
 - (New Zealand, Wellington) Sunday 14:00 - 15:00
 - (U.S., East coast) Saturday 22:00 - 23:00
 - (U.S., West coast) Saturday 19:00 - 20:00

For people in Europe, we may need to find a better time. There is probably no perfect solution,
so it may make sense to pick different times for TaichiCons to provide equal opportunities to people around the world.

TaichiCon will be hosted roughly once per month.

Attending TaichiCon
-------------------

Everyone interested in Taichi or related topics
(computer graphics, compilers, high-performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, etc.) is welcome to participate!

The Zoom meeting room has a capacity of 300 participants. A few tips:

 - It's recommended to change your Zoom display name to a uniform ``name (company)`` format. For example, ``Yuanming Hu (MIT CSAIL)``;
 - Please keep muted during the talks to avoid background noises;
 - If you have questions, feel free to raise them in the chat window;
 - Video recordings and slides will be uploaded after the conference;
 - Usually people do not open their cameras during TaichiCon to save network bandwidth for people in unsatisfactory network conditions.


Preparing for a talk at TaichiCon
---------------------------------

We welcome any topics about Taichi, including but not limited to

 - API proposals (e.g., "I think the ``Matrix`` class needs to be refactored. Here are my thoughts ...")
 - Applications (e.g., "I wrote a new fluid solver using Taichi and would like to share ...")
 - Integrations (e.g., "Here's how I integrated Taichi into Blender ...")
 - Internal designs (e.g., "How a new backend is implemented")
 - ...

The body of a TaichiCon talk should be 10 min.
After each talk, there are 5 minutes for Q & A.
The host may stop the talk if a speaker's talk lasts beyond 15 minutes.


Organizing TaichiCon
--------------------

Before the conference:

  - Pick a nice time for the event;
  - Invite speakers: ask for a talk **title**, **abstract**, and a brief **speaker introduction**;
  - Advertise the event on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Zhihu etc.);
  - Make sure all speakers are already in the (virtual) conference room 10 minutes before the conference begins;

    - If a speaker does not show up, try to remind him to attend via email.

Hosting the conference:

  - Make sure the Zoom session is being recorded;
  - Remember to welcome everyone to attend :-)
  - Before each talk, introduce the speaker;
  - In the end, thank all the speakers and attendees.

After the conference:

  - Upload the video to Youtube and Bilibili;
  - Collect speakers' slides in PDF format;

    - Make a representative image with screenshots of the first slides of all the talks;


  - Update the `TaichiCon <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichicon>`_ repository following the format of TaichiCon 0.
  - Update this documentation page if you find any opportunities to improve the workflow of TaichiCon.
