Command line utilities
======================

A successful installation of Taichi should add a CLI (Command-Line Interface) to your system,
which is helpful to perform several rountine tasks quickly. To invoke the CLI, please
run ``ti`` or ``python3 -m taichi``.

Examples
--------
Taichi provides a set of bundled examples. You could run ``ti example -h`` to print the help
message and get a list of available example names. For instance, to run the basic `fractal`
example, try: ``ti example fractal`` from your shell. (``ti example fractal.py`` should also
work)


Changelog
---------
Sometimes it's convenient to view the changelog of the current version of Taichi, to do so from
your shell, you could run ``ti changelog``.
