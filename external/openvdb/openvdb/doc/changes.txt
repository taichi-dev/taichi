  data grids to resolve compiler warnings.

@par
ABI changes:
- Added multiple new virtual functions to
  @vdblink::points::AttributeArray AttributeArray@endlink.

<B>Version 5.2.0</B> - <I>August 13, 2018</I>

@par
New features:
- Added @link points/PointAdvect.h tools@endlink to advect points
  stored in point data grids through velocity fields.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- For point data grids, voxel data can now be
  @vdblink::points::prefetch() prefetched@endlink independently of
  position or other attributes.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Added @link points/PointSample.h tools@endlink to sample voxel values
  onto points stored in point data grids.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>

@par
Improvements:
- The @vdblink::tools::UniformPointScatter UniformPointScatter@endlink tool
  now generates points in &ldquo;points per volume&rdquo; mode even when
  the product of the density and the voxel volume is less than one,
  and the point count now varies continuously with the density.
- Added a minimum/maximum sphere count argument to the
  @vdblink::tools::fillWithSpheres() fillWithSpheres@endlink tool.
  (The previous version, now deprecated, supported only a maximum
  sphere count.)
- Added a method to the level set tracking tool to enable and disable
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker::setTrimming() trimming@endlink
  of voxels outside the narrow band.
  Previously, trimming was always enabled, which caused dense SDFs
  to be converted to narrow-band level sets.
- Added @b state methods to point data
  @link points/IndexFilter.h index filters@endlink to improve
  optimization opportunities.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Added @vdblink::points::ActiveFilter active@endlink
  and @vdblink::points::InactiveFilter inactive@endlink value mask
  point data index filters.

- Computing cumulative per-leaf point offsets is now parallelized.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Made various small changes for Visual Studio&nbsp;2017 compatibility.
  <I>[Contributed by Edward&nbsp;Lam]</I>

@par
Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug that could cause an infinite loop when iterating over
  an empty root node.
- Fixed namespace-related bugs in
  @vdblink::math::Tuple::isZero() Tuple::isZero@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::Mat::isZero() Mat::isZero@endlink that led to
  compile-time errors.
- Fixed type conversion bugs in the vector-to-vector <A HREF=
  "namespaceopenvdb_1_1v5__2_1_1math.html#rotation_v1_v2"><B>rotation</B></A>
  function that made it impossible for it to return a single-precision
  rotation matrix, and modified the function to accept @b Vec3 arguments
  of any value type.
- Fixed a bug in the @link MeshToVolume.h mesh to volume@endlink converter
  that made it uninterruptible in certain cases even though
  an interrupter was provided.
  <I>[Reported&nbsp;by&nbsp;Doug&nbsp;Epps]</I>

@par
Houdini:
- Added an option to the From&nbsp;Particles&nbsp;SOP to output an
  interior mask grid.
- Added options to the Metadata&nbsp;SOP to set the grid name
  and to propagate metadata to primitive attributes and vice-versa.
- Modified <A HREF=
  "http://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk16.5/class_g_u___prim_v_d_b.html#af9274e93cc2d5d8d1f001aa7a286180a">
  <B>convertVolumesToVDBs</B></A> to set the output VDBs&rsquo; grid names
  to the names of the volume primitives.
- Added an option to the Offset&nbsp;Level&nbsp;Set,
  Renormalize&nbsp;Level&nbsp;Set, Smooth&nbsp;Level&nbsp;Set
  and Resize&nbsp;Narrow&nbsp;Band&nbsp;SOPs to enable and disable
  trimming of voxels outside the narrow band.
  Previously, trimming was always enabled, which caused dense SDFs
  to be converted to narrow-band level sets.
- Fixed a bug in the Resample&nbsp;SOP that prevented it from reading
  a reference VDB from the second input.
- Added an option to the Scatter&nbsp;SOP to scatter points only on
  an isosurface of a signed distance field.
- The Scatter&nbsp;SOP now generates points in Point&nbsp;Density mode
  even when the product of the density and the voxel volume is less than one,
  and the point count now varies continuously with the density.
- Added a minimum sphere count option to the To&nbsp;Spheres&nbsp;SOP.
- Added enable/disable toggles to the To&nbsp;Spheres&nbsp;SOP&rsquo;s
  minimum and maximum radius parameters and eliminated the world space
  radius parameters.
  The remaining minimum and maximum parameters, formerly the voxel space
  radii, are now used in both world unit and voxel unit modes.
- Added transform and rotation order options to the Transform&nbsp;SOP.
- Added support to the Advect&nbsp;Points&nbsp;SOP for advecting points
  stored in point data grids.

- Added a @c header_test Makefile target that checks library header files
  for dependencies on missing or indirectly included headers.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Added support for @vdblink::math::Mat3s Mat3s@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Mat3d Mat3d@endlink point data
  @vdblink::points::TypedAttributeArray typed attributes@endlink.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>

@par
Improvements:
- Added per-test timings to <TT>vdb_test</TT> to help in identifying
  performance regressions.
- @vdblink::zeroVal zeroVal@endlink now returns a zero matrix instead of
  an identity matrix for @vdblink::math::Mat4s Mat4s@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::Mat4d Mat4d@endlink, and it is now also defined
  (and returns a zero matrix) for @vdblink::math::Mat3s Mat3s@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::Mat3d Mat3d@endlink.

@par
Python:
- Fixed a bug introduced in version&nbsp;3.2.0 that caused
  boolean and integer values added to a grid&rsquo;s metadata
  to be stored as floating-point values.

@par
Houdini:
- Added options to the Clip&nbsp;SOP to expand or shrink the clipping region
  and, when clipping to a camera frustum, to set the near and far
  clipping planes.
- Added output grid naming options to the Points&nbsp;Convert&nbsp;SOP.
- Added a Keep&nbsp;Original&nbsp;Geometry toggle to the
  Points&nbsp;Convert&nbsp;SOP and improved the efficiency of point unpacking.

- Added an option to the Points&nbsp;Delete&nbsp;SOP to delete point groups.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nick&nbsp;Avramoussis]</I>
- Fixed a rare crash when extracting points from a point data primitive.
  <I>[Contributed by Jeff&nbsp;Lait]</I>
- Added a @b SOP_NodeVDB::evalStdString method that facilitates
  string parameter evaluation in expressions, e.g.,
  <TT>matchGroup(*gdp,&nbsp;evalStdString("group",&nbsp;time))</TT>.
- Removed the deprecated @b openvdb_houdini::validateGeometry function.
  Use @b convertGeometry instead.
- Added a @b SOP_NodeVDB::matchGroup overload that eliminates the need
  to @c const_cast the @b GU_Detail.
  <I>[Contributed by Jeff&nbsp;Lait]</I>
- Grid transforms are now more aggressively simplified, making it less likely
  to produce nonuniform voxels erroneously.
  <I>[Contributed by Jeff&nbsp;Lait]</I>
- Fixed a bug when copying and pasting a Create&nbsp;SOP that could cause
  the Voxel&nbsp;Size toggle to change state.
- Added a @b houdini_utils::OpFactory::setVerb method to register
  <A HREF="http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/model/compile">
  compilable</A>&nbsp;SOPs.
- Made @b SOP_NodeVDB::cookMySop @c final (that is, non-overridable)
  to facilitate the implementation of compilable SOPs.
  Override @b SOP_NodeVDB::cookVDBSop instead.
  (In most cases, it suffices to rename @b cookMySop to @b cookVDBSop.)
- Renamed some parameters on the following SOPs to match the equivalent
  native Houdini nodes: Advect, Advect&nbsp;Points, Analysis, Combine, Filter,
  Fracture, From&nbsp;Particles, From&nbsp;Polygons, Morph&nbsp;Level&nbsp;Set,

<B>Version 5.0.0</B> - <I>November 6, 2017</I>

@par
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some changes in this release (see @ref v5_0_0_ABI_changes "ABI changes" below)
alter the grid&nbsp;ABI so that it is incompatible with earlier versions of
the OpenVDB library, such as the ones built into Houdini up to and including
Houdini&nbsp;16.
To preserve ABI compatibility, when compiling OpenVDB or any dependent code
define the macro <TT>OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER=</TT><I>N</I>, where,
for example, <I>N</I> is 3 for Houdini&nbsp;15, 15.5 and&nbsp;16 and 4
for Houdini&nbsp;16.5.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

@par
New features:
- Added a @vdblink::getLibraryAbiVersionString()
  getLibraryAbiVersionString@endlink function, which returns a
  string such as <TT>"5.0.0abi3"</TT>.
- Added a @vdblink::WeakPtr weak pointer@endlink type alias for ABI
  compatibility.
- Metadata fields of unregistered types are no longer discarded after
  being read from a <TT>.vdb</TT> file, and although their values are not
  printable, they can be written back to disk.
- Added a @c DESTDIR_LIB_DIR Makefile variable for Linux multiarch support.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Mathieu&nbsp;Malaterre]</I>
- Added tools to create @link tools/PotentialFlow.h potential flow@endlink
  fields, as described in the 2017&nbsp;SIGGRAPH OpenVDB course.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Added @link points/PointMask.h tools@endlink to create mask grids from
  point data grids and to compute
  @vdblink::points::pointCountGrid() point counts@endlink.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Added @link points/PointScatter.h tools@endlink to scatter
  @ref secPtOverview "OpenVDB points" randomly throughout a volume.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nick&nbsp;Avramoussis]</I>

@par
Improvements:
- Significantly improved the performance of point data grid
  @vdblink::points::MultiGroupFilter group filters@endlink.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>

@par
Bug fixes:
- Fixed bugs in the
  @vdblink::tools::ClosestSurfacePoint ClosestSurfacePoint@endlink tool&rsquo;s
  distance calculations that caused searches to produce incorrect results.
- Fixed a locking issue that affected multithreaded access to
  @vdblink::points::PointDataLeafNode PointDataLeafNode@endlink&zwj;s
  when delayed loading was in effect.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>

@anchor v5_0_0_ABI_changes
@par
ABI changes:
- Made @vdblink::tree::InternalNode InternalNode@endlink&rsquo;s destructor
  non-virtual.
- The @ref v4_0_2_delayed_load_fix "fix" for a delayed-loading race condition
  in the @vdblink::tree::LeafBuffer LeafBuffer@endlink class that was only
  partially rolled out in the previous release is now enabled on all platforms.
- Replaced a bit flag with an atomic integer in
  @vdblink::points::AttributeArray points::AttributeArray@endlink
  to address a threading issue during delayed loading.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Deprecated the @c OPENVDB_2_ABI_COMPATIBLE and @c OPENVDB_3_ABI_COMPATIBLE
  macros in favor of a new @c OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER macro.
  The new macro defaults to the library major version number but can be
  set at compile time to an earlier version number to disable ABI changes
  since that version.
  (Older ABIs will not be supported indefinitely, however.)
  For example, compile OpenVDB and any dependent code with
  <TT>-DOPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER=4</TT> to use the 4.x&nbsp;ABI.

@par
API changes:
- Replaced @b tools::ClosestSurfacePoint::initialize with
  @vdblink::tools::ClosestSurfacePoint::create()
  tools::ClosestSurfacePoint::create@endlink,
  which returns a newly-allocated and properly initialized object.
- Removed methods that were deprecated in version&nbsp;4.0.0 or earlier,
  including @b io::File::readGridPartial, @b points::initialize,
  @b points::uninitialize and @b util::PagedArray::pop_back.
- Deprecated @vdblink::IllegalValueException IllegalValueException@endlink
  in favor of @vdblink::ValueError ValueError@endlink.
- Changed the naming scheme for the
  @link OPENVDB_VERSION_NAME library namespace@endlink
  from <B>openvdb::v</B><I>X</I><B>_</B><I>Y</I><B>_</B><I>Z</I>
  to <B>openvdb::v</B><I>X</I><B>_</B><I>Y</I><B>abi</B><I>N</I>,
  where @e X, @e Y, @e Z and @e N are the major, minor, patch and ABI
  version numbers, respectively.
  The <B>abi</B><I>N</I> suffix is added only when the library is built
  using an older ABI version.

@par
Python:
- Reimplemented NumPy support for Boost&nbsp;1.65 compatibility.

@par
Houdini:
- Fixed bugs that caused the Ray&nbsp;SOP&rsquo;s closest surface point
  searches to produce incorrect results.

  to @b std::function.
- Changed the @b houdini_utils::OpPolicyPtr type from @b boost:shared_ptr
  to @b std::shared_ptr.
- Debug-level log messages generated by OpenVDB are no longer forwarded
  to Houdini&rsquo;s error manager.
- Fixed a bug in the Read&nbsp;SOP that made it impossible to select among
  grids of the same name in a file.
- Added @b houdini_utils::ParmFactory::setAttrChoiceList, a convenience
  method for the creation of menus of attributes.

<B>Version 4.0.2</B> - <I>July 28, 2017</I>
@par
New features:
- Added @vdblink::tools::compActiveLeafVoxels compActiveLeafVoxels@endlink,
  which composites active voxel values from a source tree into a destination
  tree.
  It is threaded and faster than existing tools that merge trees, however
  it operates only on leaf nodes.
- Added a <TT>vdb_test&nbsp;-f</TT> option that reads a list of tests
  to be run from a text file.
- Added functions for @link points/PointDelete.h deleting points@endlink
  from point data grids based on group membership.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Enabled display of point data grids in <TT>vdb_view</TT>.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nick&nbsp;Avramoussis]</I>
- Added a view mode indicator to <TT>vdb_view</TT>.
- Added @vdblink::math::Mat::isFinite() isFinite@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::Mat::isNan() isNan@endlink, and
  @vdblink::math::Mat::isZero() isZero@endlink methods to
  @vdblink::math::Mat math::Mat@endlink and added
  @vdblink::math::Tuple::isZero() isZero@endlink to
  @vdblink::math::Tuple math::Tuple@endlink.
- Added @vdblink::tools::interiorMask() tools::interiorMask@endlink,
  which constructs a boolean mask grid from the active voxels of an
  input grid or, if the input grid is a level set, from the interior
  voxels of the level set.
- Added @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::begin() begin@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::end() end@endlink iterator methods
  (and related methods) to @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink,
  so that it can be used in range-based <TT>for</TT>&nbsp;loops.
- The @link tools/Clip.h clip@endlink tool now accepts either a box,
  a mask grid or a camera frustum as the clipping region.
  The latter is new in this version.

@par
Improvements:
- Moved the @vdblink::math::Tuple::isFinite() isFinite@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::Tuple::isInfinite() isInfinite@endlink,
  and @vdblink::math::Tuple::isNan() isNan@endlink methods from
  @vdblink::math::Vec3 math::Vec3@endlink et&nbsp;al.
  to @vdblink::math::Tuple math::Tuple@endlink.

@par
Bug fixes:
- @anchor v4_0_2_delayed_load_fix
  Fixed a delayed-loading race condition that could result in crashes.
  <I>[Reported&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  @b Note: To preserve ABI compatibility, this fix is currently enabled
  only on platforms for which the alignment of a
  <TT>tbb::atomic&lt;uint32_t&gt;</TT> is the same as for a @c uint32_t.
  On other platforms, warnings will be logged during OpenVDB initialization,
  and it is recommended to disable delayed loading in that case (for example,
  by defining the environment variable @c OPENVDB_DISABLE_DELAYED_LOAD).
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
- Fixed a delayed-loading memory leak in the
  @vdblink::points::PointDataLeafNode PointDataLeafNode@endlink.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Changed the random number seeding mechanism for <TT>.vdb</TT> file UUIDs
  to avoid duplicate&nbsp;IDs.
  <I>[Reported&nbsp;by&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;Lefley]</I>
- Fixed an off-by-one bug in the
  @vdblink::tools::GridResampler resampler@endlink that produced grid patterns
  of missing interior voxels for scale factors greater than one.

@par
Houdini:
- As of Houdini&nbsp;16.0.549, @c houdini_utils::OpFactory can generate
  help cards for operators automatically.
  New @c OpFactory::setDocumentation and @c ParmFactory::setDocumentation
  methods allow one to add custom help text in
  <A HREF="http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/help/format">wiki markup</A>
  format.
- Added help cards for all SOPs.  Houdini&nbsp;16.0.578 or later is required.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey&nbsp;and&nbsp;SideFX]</I>
- The Extended Operator Info window in Houdini&nbsp;16 now renders correctly
  for OpenVDB SOPs, instead of displaying a Python stack trace.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Bailey]</I>
- Added a Points Delete SOP for deleting points from point data grids
  based on group membership.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Added a Mantra VRAY procedural and a delayed load SHOP for rendering
  point data grids.
  Houdini&nbsp;16 is required.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Replaced the Combine SOP&rsquo;s &ldquo;A/B&nbsp;Pairs&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;Flatten&rdquo; toggles with a menu of collation options
  that include flattening only <I>A</I>&nbsp;grids and flattening groups
  of <I>A</I>&nbsp;grids independently.
- Added a slider to the Remove Divergence SOP to set the error tolerance
  for the pressure solver.
- Added value type conversion options (for VDB output) to the Convert&nbsp;SOP.
- Added a Densify SOP that replaces active tiles with leaf voxels.
- Fixed a bug in the Rasterize Points&nbsp;SOP that capped density values
  to one instead of to the particles&rsquo; densities.
- The Convert and To&nbsp;Polygons SOPs now accept grids of any type
  as surface masks, not just level set or SDF grids.
- Added an option to the Clip&nbsp;SOP to clip to a camera frustum.

  for @vdblink::StringMetadata StringMetadata@endlink that eliminates
  the overhead of writing to a string stream.
- Made various minor improvements to @vdblink::util::PagedArray
  util::PagedArray@endlink.
- Added an @c install_lib build target to the Makefile.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Added @subpage points "documentation" and Cookbook
  @ref openvdbPointsHelloWorld "examples" for OpenVDB&nbsp;Points.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Registration of OpenVDB&nbsp;Points grid and attribute types is now
  handled in @vdblink::initialize() openvdb::initialize@endlink,
  and @vdblink::points::initialize() points::initialize@endlink
  and @vdblink::points::uninitialize() points::uninitialize@endlink
  are therefore deprecated.
- Extended multi-pass I/O to handle a variable number of passes per leaf node.

New features:
- Added an option to the @link PointScatter.h point scattering@endlink tools
  to specify how far each point may be displaced from the center of its
  host voxel or tile.
- Added a toggle to the @vdblink::tools::clip() clip@endlink tool
  to invert the clipping mask.
- Custom leaf node implementations may now optimize their file layout
  by inheriting from @vdblink::io::MultiPass io::MultiPass@endlink.
  Voxel data for grids with such leaf nodes will be written and read in
  multiple passes, allowing blocks of related data to be stored contiguously.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::unallocatedLeafCount()
  Tree::unallocatedLeafCount@endlink, which returns the number of leaf
  nodes with unallocated data buffers (typically due to delayed loading).

@par
Improvements:
- Vector-valued grids are now constructed and destroyed much faster.
- Changed @vdblink::math::Coord Coord@endlink&rsquo;s data representation
  to facilitate C++11 uniform initialization.
- Delayed loading from @vdblink::io::File io::Files@endlink is now faster
  due to the use of seeks instead of reads.

  @vdblink::tools::VelocityIntegrator VelocityIntegrator@endlink (formerly
  in tools/PointAdvect.h) into a single header, tools/VelocityFields.h.
- Modified the @vdblink::tools::signedFloodFill() signed flood fill@endlink
  tool to accept grids of any signed scalar value type, not just
  floating-point grids.
- The @vdblink::tools::prune() prune@endlink tool is now faster, and it employs
  an improved compression technique on trees with floating-point values.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a build issue that could result in spurious &ldquo;Blosc encoding
  is not supported&rdquo; errors unless @c OPENVDB_USE_BLOSC was
  <TT>@#define</TT>d when compiling client code.
- Added NaN and inf checks to the
  @vdblink::tools::PointPartitioner point partitioning@endlink tool.
- Fixed a <TT>vdb_view</TT> issue whereby the frame buffer size did not
  necessarily match the window size.
  <I>[Contributed by Rafael&nbsp;Campos]</I>
- Fixed a roundoff issue in
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker LevelSetTracker@endlink
  that could result in NaNs.
- Changed @vdblink::tools::CheckNormGrad CheckNormGrad@endlink to check
  the magnitude of the gradient rather than the square of the magnitude.
- Fixed parameter type inconsistencies in math/Ray.h and
  tools/RayIntersector.h.
  <I>[Contributed by K&eacute;vin&nbsp;Dietrich]</I>
- Fixed incorrect handling of signed values in the
  @vdblink::tools::clip() clip@endlink tool (and the Clip SOP).

@par
API changes:
- Removed the <TT>math::Hermite</TT> class since it was no longer used
  and caused build issues for some.
- Refactored the @vdblink::tools::LevelSetAdvection level set advection@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter level set filtering@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetMeasure level set measuring@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker level set tracking@endlink tools.
- Extended the API of the @vdblink::tools::Diagnose Diagnose@endlink tool
  and disabled copy construction.
- Extended and unified the API of various Samplers.
- Added an optional template argument to the
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor ValueAccessor@endlink class
  to allow for unregistered accessors.

@par
Houdini:
- Added a Rasterize Points SOP that produces density volumes and transfers
  arbitrary point attributes using a weighted-average scheme.
  The node incorporates a VOP subnetwork for procedural modeling,
  and its accompanying creation script defines a default network with
  VEX procedures for cloud and velocity field modeling.
  (See the creation script file header for installation details.)
- Merged the Advect Level Set SOP into a new Advect SOP that supports
  advection of arbitrary volumes, not just level sets.
- Added a Remove Divergence SOP that eliminates divergence from a
  velocity field.
- Added a Diagnostics SOP that can identify various problems with
  level sets, fog volumes and other grids.
- Added a Sort Points SOP that spatially reorders a list of points
  so that points that are close together in space are also close together
  in the list.
  This can improve CPU cache coherency and performance for
  random-access operations.
- Added a Remap SOP that maps voxel values in an input range to values
  in an output range through a user-defined transfer function.
- Added an option to the Convert SOP to activate interior voxels.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- The To Spheres SOP can now optionally output a <TT>pscale</TT> attribute.
- Added <TT>openvdb_houdini::SOP_NodeVDB::duplicateSourceStealable()</TT>,
  which in conjunction with the Unload flag can help to minimize deep copying
  of grids between nodes.
  The Advect, Convert, Fill, Filter, Fracture, Noise, Offset Level Set,
  Prune, Remap, Remove Divergence, Renormalize Level Set, Resize Narrow Band,
  Smooth Level Set and Transform SOPs all have this optimization enabled,
  meaning that they can potentially steal, rather than copy, data from
  upstream nodes that have the Unload flag enabled.
  <I>[Contributed by Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Redesigned the UI of the Visualize SOP and added toggles to draw with
  or without color, to use the grid name as the attribute name for points
  with values, and to attach grid index coordinates to points.
- Added toggles to the Filter, Rebuild Level Set, Resize Narrow Band,
  Smooth Level Set and To Spheres SOPs to specify units in either
  world space or index space.
- Fixed an issue whereby grids generated by the Rebuild Level Set SOP
  did not always display as surfaces in the viewport.
- The Metadata SOP now sets appropriate viewport visualization options
  when the grid class is changed.

<B>Version 3.0.0</B> - <I>January 14, 2015</I>
- The @vdblink::io::File File@endlink class now supports delayed loading of
  <TT>.vdb</TT> files, meaning that memory is not allocated for voxel values
  until the values are actually accessed. (This feature is enabled by default.)
  Until a grid has been fully loaded, its source <TT>.vdb</TT> file must not be
  modified or deleted, so for safety,
  @vdblink::io::File::open() File::open@endlink automatically makes
  private copies of source files that are smaller than a user-specified limit
  (see @vdblink::io::File::setCopyMaxBytes() File::setCopyMaxBytes@endlink).
  The limit can be set to zero to disable copying, but if it cannot be
  guaranteed that a file will not be modified, then it is best not to enable
  delayed loading for that file.
- <TT>.vdb</TT> files can now optionally be compressed with the Blosc&nbsp;LZ4
  codec.  <A HREF="http://www.blosc.org/">Blosc</A> compresses almost as well
  as ZLIB, but it is much faster.
- Added @vdblink::tools::PointPartitioner PointPartitioner@endlink, a tool
  for fast spatial sorting of points stored in an external array, and
  @link PointIndexGrid.h PointIndexGrid@endlink, an acceleration structure
  for fast range and nearest-neighbor searches.
- Added @link NodeManager.h tree::NodeManager@endlink,
  which linearizes a tree to facilitate efficient multithreading
  across all tree levels.
- Added @vdblink::tools::prune() tools::prune@endlink (and other variants),
  which replaces and outperforms @c Tree::prune.
- Added @vdblink::tools::signedFloodFill() tools::signedFloodFill@endlink,
  which replaces and outperforms @c Tree::signedFloodFill.
- Added @vdblink::tools::changeBackground() tools::changeBackground@endlink
  (and other variants), which replaces and outperforms @c Tree::setBackground().
- Added a fast but approximate narrow-band level set
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker::dilate() dilation@endlink method, a fast
  narrow-band level set
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker::erode() erosion@endlink
  method, and a @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker::normalize(const MaskType*)
  masked normalization@endlink method to
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker LevelSetTracker@endlink.
- Added @vdblink::tools::Diagnose Diagnose@endlink, which performs
  multithreaded diagnostics on grids to identify issues like values that
  are NaNs or out-of-range. It optionally generates a boolean grid of all
  values that fail user-defined tests.
- Added optional alpha masks to @vdblink::tools::LevelSetMorphing
  LevelSetMorphing@endlink.
- Fixed an intermittent crash in
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetMorphing LevelSetMorphing@endlink.
- Added @c tools::topologyToLevelSet(),
  which generates a level set from the implicit boundary between active
  and inactive voxels in an arbitrary input grid.
  <I>[DWA internal]</I>
- Improved the performance of point scattering (by orders of magnitude)
  and added a
  @vdblink::tools::DenseUniformPointScatter DenseUniformPointScatter@endlink
  class as well as support for fractional numbers of particles per voxel.
- Improved the performance and memory footprint of
  the @vdblink::tools::ParticlesToLevelSet ParticlesToLevelSet@endlink tool
  for large numbers (tens to hundreds of millions) of particles.
- Added edge-adjacent (6+12=18 neighbors) and vertex-adjacent (6+12+8=26
  neighbors) dilation algorithms to
  @vdblink::tools::Morphology::dilateVoxels Morphology::dilateVoxels@endlink.
  The default dilation pattern is still face-adjacent (6&nbsp;neighbors).
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::getNodes() Tree::getNodes@endlink, which allows
  for fast construction of linear arrays of tree nodes for use in multithreaded
  code such as the @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink or
  @link NodeManager.h tree::NodeManager@endlink.
- Added @vdblink::math::Extrema math::Extrema@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::extrema() tools::extrema@endlink to efficiently
  compute minimum and maximum values in a grid.
- Added support for material color grids to all level set
  @vdblink::tools::BaseShader shaders@endlink, and added an option to
  @c vdb_render that allows one to specify a reference grid to be used
  for material color lookups.
- Added @vdblink::getLibraryVersionString()
  getLibraryVersionString@endlink and
  @link OPENVDB_LIBRARY_VERSION_STRING@endlink.
- Modified the mesh to volume converter to always set the grid background
  value to the exterior narrow-band width, and added finite value checks
  to narrow band parameters.
- @vdblink::tools::volumeToMesh() tools::volumeToMesh@endlink now compiles
  for all grid types but throws an exception if the input grid does not
  have a scalar value type.
- Added a
  @vdblink::io::File::readGrid(const Name&, const BBoxd&) File::readGrid@endlink
  overload and @vdblink::GridBase::readBuffers(std::istream&, const CoordBBox&)
  readBuffers@endlink overloads to the grid, tree and node classes that allow
  one to specify a bounding box against which to clip a grid while reading it.
  For large grids, clipping while reading can result in significantly lower
  memory usage than clipping after reading.
- Added @vdblink::GridBase::clipGrid() GridBase::clipGrid@endlink, which
  clips a grid against a world-space bounding box, and
  @vdblink::GridBase::clip() GridBase::clip@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::clip() Tree::clip@endlink, which clip against
  an index-space bounding box.
- Added @vdblink::tools::clip() tools::clip@endlink, which clips a grid
  either against a bounding box or against the active voxels of a mask grid.
- @c io::File::readGridPartial allocates the nodes of a grid&rsquo;s tree
  as before, but it now allocates leaf nodes without data buffers.
  (This feature is mainly for internal use.
  Partially-read grids should be used with care if at all, and they should
  be treated as read-only.)
- Grid names retrieved using a
  @vdblink::io::File::NameIterator File::NameIterator@endlink now always
  uniquely identify grids; they no longer generate &lsquo;more than one grid
  named&nbsp;&ldquo;<I>x</I>&rdquo;&rsquo; warnings when there are multiple
  grids of the same name in a file (for files written starting with this
  version of the OpenVDB library).
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::tree::Tree::ValueOffIter Tree::ValueOffIter@endlink
  that could cause
  @vdblink::tree::TreeValueIteratorBase::setMaxDepth() depth-bounded@endlink
  iterators to return incorrect values.
- Eliminated a recursive call in @vdblink::tree::TreeValueIteratorBase::next()
  TreeValueIteratorBase::next@endlink that could cause crashes on systems
  with a limited stack size.
- Fixed memory leaks in @vdblink::tree::RootNode::topologyDifference()
  RootNode::topologyDifference@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::topologyIntersection()
  RootNode::topologyIntersection@endlink.
- Fixed a memory leak in @vdblink::io::Queue io::Queue@endlink when the queue
  was full and a write task could not be added within the timeout interval.
- Fixed a potential division by zero crash in
  @vdblink::tools::compDiv() tools::compDiv@endlink with integer-valued grids.
- Fixed kernel normalization in the @vdblink::tools::Filter filter tool@endlink
  so that it is correct for integer-valued grids.
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::tree::LeafBuffer::getValue()
  LeafNode::Buffer::getValue@endlink whereby Visual C++ would return
  a reference to a temporary.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::tools::ParticlesToLevelSet
  tools::ParticlesToLevelSet@endlink related to attribute transfer
  when leaf nodes are produced without active values.
- Added @vdblink::util::CpuTimer util::CpuTimer@endlink and removed
  the more simplistic @c unittest_util::CpuTimer from @c unittest/util.h.
- Eliminated the use of @c getopt for command-line argument parsing
  in @c vdb_test.
- @vdblink::initialize() openvdb::initialize@endlink now properly initializes
  <A HREF="http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/">log4cplus</A> if it is enabled,
  eliminating &ldquo;No appenders could be found&rdquo; errors.
- Fixed a bug in the
  @vdblink::math::QuantizedUnitVec::pack() QuantizedUnitVec::pack@endlink
  method that caused quantization artifacts.
- Added convenience class @vdblink::tools::AlphaMask AlphaMask@endlink
- Added constructors and methods to both
  @vdblink::math::RandInt RandInt@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Rand01 Rand01@endlink to set and reset the random seed value.
- Added convenience methods for
  @vdblink::math::Transform::indexToWorld(const BBoxd&) const transforming@endlink
  @vdblink::math::Transform::worldToIndex(const BBoxd&) const bounding@endlink
  @vdblink::math::Transform::worldToIndexCellCentered(const BBoxd&) const boxes@endlink
  to @vdblink::math::Transform math::Transform@endlink.
- @c vdb_view is now compatible with both GLFW&nbsp;2 and GLFW&nbsp;3.
- Made many small changes to address type conversion and other warnings
  reported by newer compilers like GCC&nbsp;4.8 and ICC&nbsp;14.
- Replaced the @c HALF_INCL_DIR and @c HALF_LIB_DIR Makefile variables
  with @c ILMBASE_INCL_DIR and @c ILMBASE_LIB_DIR and added @c ILMBASE_LIB,
  to match <A HREF="https://github.com/openexr/openexr">OpenEXR</A>&rsquo;s
  library organization.  <I>[Contributed by Double&nbsp;Negative]</I>
- Eliminated most local (function-scope) static variables, because
  Visual&nbsp;C++ doesn&rsquo;t guarantee thread-safe initialization
  of local statics.  <I>[Contributed by&nbsp;SESI]</I>
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::readString() readString@endlink related
  to empty strings.
  <I>[Contributed by Fabio&nbsp;Piparo]</I>
- Fixed a bug in the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh VolumeToMesh@endlink
  simplification scheme that was creating visual artifacts.

@par
API changes:
- The addition of a
  @vdblink::GridBase::readBuffers(std::istream&, const CoordBBox&)
  GridBase::readBuffers@endlink virtual function overload and the
  @vdblink::GridBase::clip() GridBase::clip@endlink
  @vdblink::GridBase::readNonresidentBuffers()
  GridBase::readNonresidentBuffers@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::clipUnallocatedNodes() Tree::clipUnallocatedNodes@endlink
  virtual functions changes the grid ABI so that it is incompatible with
  earlier versions of the OpenVDB library (such as the ones in Houdini 12.5
  and&nbsp;13).  Define the macro @c OPENVDB_2_ABI_COMPATIBLE when compiling
  OpenVDB to disable these changes and preserve ABI compatibility.
- All @vdblink::tools::BaseShader shaders@endlink now have a template argument
  to specify the type of an optional material color grid, but the default type
  mimics the old, uniform color behavior.
- Removed a deprecated
  @vdblink::io::Stream::write() io::Stream::write@endlink overload.
- The point counts in
  @vdblink::tools::UniformPointScatter UniformPointScatter@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::NonUniformPointScatter NonUniformPointScatter@endlink
  are now specified and returned as @vdblink::Index64 Index64@endlink.
- @vdblink::math::RandInt RandInt@endlink has an extra template argument
  to specify the integer type.
  The @vdblink::math::RandomInt RandomInt@endlink typedef is unchanged.
- @vdblink::io::readData() io::readData@endlink,
  @vdblink::io::HalfReader<false,T>::read() io::HalfReader::read@endlink
  and @vdblink::io::HalfWriter<false,T>::write() io::HalfWriter::write@endlink
  now take a @c uint32_t argument indicating the type of compression
  instead of a @c bool indicating whether compression is enabled.
- Removed @c io::Archive::isCompressionEnabled() and
  @c io::Archive::setCompressionEnabled() and renamed
  @c io::Archive::compressionFlags() and @c io::Archive::setCompressionFlags()
  to @vdblink::io::Archive::compression() io::Archive::compression@endlink and
  @vdblink::io::Archive::setCompression() io::Archive::setCompression@endlink.
- Internal and leaf node classes are now required to provide
  "PartialCreate" constructors that optionally bypass the allocation
  of voxel buffers.  Leaf node classes must now also provide
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::allocate() allocate@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::isAllocated() isAllocated@endlink methods
  to manage the allocation of their buffers.
- Removed @c pruneInactive and @c pruneLevelSet methods from the
  @vdblink::tree::Tree Tree@endlink and various node classes.
  These methods have been replaced by the much faster pruning functions
  found in tools/Prune.h.
- Removed @c signedFloodFill methods from the @vdblink::Grid Grid@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree Tree@endlink and various node classes.
  These methods have been replaced by the much faster functions
  found in tools/SignedFloodFill.h.
- Removed @c Grid::setBackground() and @c Tree::setBackground() (use the
  faster @vdblink::tools::changeBackground() changeBackground@endlink tool
  instead), and removed the default argument from
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::setBackground() RootNode::setBackground@endlink.

@par
Python:
- Added grid methods @c convertToPolygons() and @c convertToQuads(),
  which convert volumes to meshes, and @c createLevelSetFromPolygons(),
  which converts meshes to volumes.
  <A HREF="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/">NumPy</A> is required.

@par
Maya:
- Added an adaptive polygonal surface extraction node.

@par
Houdini:
- Added a new Resize Narrow Band SOP that can efficiently adjust the width
  of a level set&rsquo;s narrow band.  This allows, for example, for a
  level set to be created quickly from points or polygons with a very
  narrow band that is then quickly resized to a desired width.
- Fixed bugs in the Smooth Level Set and Reshape Level Set SOPs that
  caused them to ignore the selected discretization scheme.
- Added a Morph Level Set SOP.
- Added a From Points SOP to very quickly generate a level set
  from a point cloud, ignoring any radius attribute.
  <I>[DWA internal]</I>
- Added a Voxel Scale mode to the Resample SOP.
- Improved the performance and memory footprint of the From Particles SOP
  for large numbers (tens to hundreds of millions) of particles.
- The Scatter SOP now accepts fractional numbers of particles per voxel.
- Improved the performance of the Scatter SOP by more than an order
  of magnitude.
- The Clip SOP now has a toggle to choose explicitly between a mask grid
  or a bounding box as the clipping region.  As a consequence, the mask grid
  can now be unnamed.
- Added the OpenVDB library version number to the Extended Operator
  Information for all SOPs.
- SOPs are now linked with an rpath to the directory containing the
  OpenVDB library.
- Like the native Houdini file SOP, the Read SOP now allows missing frames
  to be reported either as errors or as warnings.
- The Read SOP now has an optional input for geometry, the bounding box
  of which can be used to clip grids as they are read.  For large grids,
  clipping while reading can result in significantly lower memory usage
  than clipping after reading.
- The From Polygons and Convert SOPs now default to using the polygon soup
  mesh representation, which uses less memory.

  which selectively extracts and transforms data from a dense grid to
  produce a sparse tree, and @vdblink::tools::extractSparseTreeWithMask()
  extractSparseTreeWithMask@endlink, which copies data from the index-space
  intersection of a sparse tree and a dense input grid.
- Added copy constructors to the
  @vdblink::Grid::Grid(const Grid<OtherTreeType>&) Grid@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::Tree(const Tree<OtherRootType>&) Tree@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::RootNode(const RootNode<OtherChildType>&)
  RootNode@endlink,

  InternalNode@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::LeafNode(const LeafNode<OtherValueType, Log2Dim>&) LeafNode@endlink
  classes, and an assignment operator overload to
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::operator=(const RootNode<OtherChildType>&)
  RootNode@endlink, that allow the source and destination to have different
  value types.
- Modified @vdblink::tree::Tree::combine2() Tree::combine2@endlink to permit
  combination of trees with different value types.
- Added @vdblink::CanConvertType CanConvertType@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::SameConfiguration
  RootNode::SameConfiguration@endlink metafunctions, which perform compile-time
  tests for value type and tree type compatibility, and a
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::hasCompatibleValueType()
  RootNode::hasCompatibleValueType@endlink method, which does runtime checking.
- Added optional support for logging using
  <A HREF="http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/">log4cplus</A>.
  See logging.h and the @c INSTALL file for details.
- Added  @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector::hits()
  VolumeRayIntersector::hits@endlink, which returns all the hit segments
  along a ray.  This is generally more efficient than repeated calls to
  @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector::march()
  VolumeRayIntersector::march@endlink.
- Added member class @vdblink::math::Ray::TimeSpan Ray::TimeSpan@endlink
  and method @vdblink::math::Ray::valid() Ray::valid@endlink, and deprecated
  method @vdblink::math::Ray::test() Ray::test@endlink.

  cause rendering artifacts when a ray&rsquo;s start time was zero.
  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Mike&nbsp;Farnsworth]</I>
- Added a @vdblink::tools::compositeToDense() compositeToDense@endlink tool,
  which composites data from a sparse tree into a dense array, using a
  sparse alpha mask.  Over, Add, Sub, Min, Max, Mult, and Set are
  supported operations.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::transformDense() transformDense@endlink tool,
  which applies a functor to the value of each voxel of a dense grid
  within a given bounding box.
- Improved the performance of node iterators.

API changes:
- Collected the digital differential analyzer code from math/Ray.h
  and tools/RayIntersector.h into a new header file, math/DDA.h.
- Rewrote @vdblink::math::VolumeHDDA VolumeHDDA@endlink and made several
  changes to its API.  (@vdblink::math::VolumeHDDA VolumeHDDA@endlink
  is used internally by @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector
  VolumeRayIntersector@endlink, whose API is unchanged.)

  @vdblink::tree::InternalNode::combine2() InternalNode::combine2@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::combine2() LeafNode::combine2@endlink
  and @vdblink::CombineArgs CombineArgs@endlink all now require an additional
  template argument, which determines the type of the other tree.
- Assignment operators for
  @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::LeafRange::Iterator::operator=()
  LeafManager::LeafRange::Iterator@endlink,
  @vdblink::util::BaseMaskIterator::operator=() BaseMaskIterator@endlink,
  @vdblink::util::NodeMask::operator=() NodeMask@endlink and
  @vdblink::util::RootNodeMask::operator=() RootNodeMask@endlink
  now return references to the respective objects.
- Removed a number of methods that were deprecated in version&nbsp;2.0.0
  or earlier.

@par
Houdini:
- Added a Clip SOP, which does volumetric clipping.
- Added an Occlusion Mask SOP, which generates a mask of the voxels
  inside a camera frustum that are occluded by objects in an input grid.
- The Combine SOP now applies the optional signed flood fill only to
  level set grids, since that operation isn&rsquo;t meaningful for other grids.
- The Filter SOP now processes all grid types, not just scalar grids.

  command-line renderer.
- Added an option to the

  to return the time of intersection along a world or index ray and to
  return the level set isovalue.
- Improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector VolumeRayIntersector@endlink
  and added support for voxel dilation to account for interpolation kernels.
- Added a @ref sInterpolation "section" to the Cookbook on interpolation
  using @vdblink::tools::BoxSampler BoxSampler@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::DualGridSampler DualGridSampler@endlink, et al.
- Added a @ref secGrid "section" to the Overview on grids and grid metadata.
- Modified @vdblink::tools::DualGridSampler DualGridSampler@endlink so
  it is more consistent with @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink.

- Added a @vdblink::tools::transformVectors() transformVectors@endlink tool,
  which applies an affine transformation to the voxel values of a
  vector-valued grid in accordance with the grid&rsquo;s
  @vdblink::VecType vector type@endlink and
  @vdblink::Grid::isInWorldSpace() world space/local space@endlink setting.

  <I>[Contributed&nbsp;by&nbsp;SESI]</I>

@par
API changes:
- @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector::march()
  VolumeRayIntersector::march@endlink no longer returns an @c int
  to distinguish tile vs. voxel hits.  Instead, it now returns @c false
  if no intersection is detected and @c true otherwise.  Also, @e t0 and
  @e t1 might now correspond to the first and last hits of multiple adjacent
  leaf nodes and/or active tiles.
- @vdblink::tools::DualGridSampler DualGridSampler@endlink is no longer
  templated on the target grid type, and the value accessor is now passed
  as an argument.
- The <TT>.vdb</TT> file format has changed slightly.  Tools built with older
  versions of OpenVDB should be recompiled to ensure that they can read files
  in the new format.

@par
Houdini:
- Added topology union, intersection and difference operations to
  the Combine SOP.  These operations combine the active voxel topologies
  of grids that may have different value types.
- Added a Divide operation to the Combine SOP.
- Added support for boolean grids to the Combine, Resample, Scatter, Prune
  and Visualize SOPs.
- The Fill SOP now accepts a vector as the fill value, and it allows
  the fill region bounds to be specified either in index space (as before),
  in world space, or using the bounds of geometry connected to an optional
  new reference input.
- Added a toggle to the Offset Level Set SOP to specify the offset in
  either world or voxel units.
- Added a toggle to the Transform and Resample SOPs to apply the transform
  to the voxel values of vector-valued grids, in accordance with those
  grids&rsquo; @vdblink::VecType vector types@endlink and
  @vdblink::Grid::isInWorldSpace() world space/local space@endlink settings.
- Added a Vector Type menu to the Vector Merge SOP.
- Removed masking options from the Renormalize SOP (since masking is
  not supported yet).
- Reimplemented the Vector Merge SOP for better performance and
  interruptibility and to fix a bug in the handling of tile values.


@htmlonly <a name="v2_1_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 2.1.0</B> - <I>December 12, 2013</I>
- Added a small number of Maya nodes, primarily for conversion of geometry
  to and from OpenVDB volumes and for visualization of volumes.
- Added an initial implementation of
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetMorphing level set morphing@endlink
  (with improvements to follow soon).
- Added @vdblink::tools::LevelSetMeasure tools::LevelSetMeasure@endlink,
  which efficiently computes the surface area, volume and average
  mean-curvature of narrow-band level sets, in both world and voxel units.
  Those quantities are now exposed as intrinsic attributes on the Houdini
  VDB primitive and can be queried using the native Measure SOP.
- @vdblink::tools::Dense tools::Dense@endlink now supports the XYZ memory
  layout used by Houdini and Maya in addition to the ZYX layout used in
  OpenVDB trees.
- Improved the performance of masking in the
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter level set filter@endlink tool and
  added inversion and scaling of the mask input, so that any scalar-valued
  volume can be used as a mask, not just volumes with a [0,&nbsp;1] range.
- Added optional masking to the non-level-set filters, to the grid
  operators (CPT, curl, divergence, gradient, Laplacian, mean curvature,
  magnitude, and normalize) and to the Analysis and Filter SOPs.
- Added more narrow band controls to the Rebuild Level Set SOP.
- Improved the accuracy of the
  @vdblink::tools::levelSetRebuild() level set rebuild@endlink tool.
- Added @vdblink::tools::activate() tools::activate@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::deactivate() tools::deactivate@endlink, which set the
  active states of tiles and voxels whose values are equal to or approximately
  equal to a given value, and added a Deactivate Background Voxels toggle
  to the Combine SOP.
- Added @vdblink::math::BBox::applyMap() BBox::applyMap@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::BBox::applyInverseMap() BBox::applyInverseMap@endlink,
  which allow for transformation of axis-aligned bounding boxes.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::PositionShader position shader@endlink to the
  level set ray-tracer (primarily for debugging purposes).
- Added an @vdblink::io::Queue io::Queue@endlink class that manages a
  concurrent queue for asynchronous serialization of grids to files or streams.
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::io::Archive io::Archive@endlink whereby writing
  unnamed, instanced grids (i.e., grids sharing a tree) to a file rendered
  the file unreadable.
- Fixed a bug in the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh volume to mesh@endlink
  converter that caused it to generate invalid polygons when the zero crossing
  lay between active and inactive regions.
- Fixed a bug in the @vdblink::tools::UniformPointScatter point scatter@endlink
  tool (and the Scatter SOP) whereby the last voxel always remained empty.
- Fixed a bug in the Read SOP that caused grids with the same name
  to be renamed with a numeric suffix (e.g., &ldquo;grid[1]&rdquo;
  &ldquo;grid[2]&rdquo;, etc.).
- Fixed some unit test failures on 64-bit Itanium machines.

@par
API changes:
- The @vdblink::tools::Filter Filter@endlink tool is now templated on a
  mask grid, and threading is controlled using a grain size, for consistency
  with most of the other level set tools.
- The @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter LevelSetFilter@endlink tool is now
  templated on a mask grid.
- All shaders now take a ray direction instead of a ray.


@htmlonly <a name="v2_0_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 2.0.0</B> - <I>October 31, 2013</I>
- Added a @ref python "Python module" with functions for basic manipulation
  of grids (but no tools, yet).
- Added ray intersector tools for efficient, hierarchical intersection
  of rays with @vdblink::tools::LevelSetRayIntersector level-set@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector generic@endlink volumes.
- Added a @vdblink::math::Ray Ray@endlink class and a hierarchical
  @vdblink::math::DDA Digital Differential Analyzer@endlink for fast
  ray traversal.
- Added a fully multi-threaded @vdblink::tools::LevelSetRayTracer
  level set ray tracer@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::PerspectiveCamera camera@endlink
  @vdblink::tools::OrthographicCamera classes@endlink
  that mimic Houdini&rsquo;s cameras.
- Added a simple, command-line renderer (currently for level sets only).
- Implemented a new meshing scheme that produces topologically robust
  two-manifold meshes and is twice as fast as the previous scheme.
- Implemented a new, topologically robust (producing two-manifold meshes)
  level-set-based seamless fracture scheme.  The new scheme eliminates
  visible scarring seen in the previous implementation by subdividing
  internal, nonplanar quads near fracture seams.  In addition,
  fracture seam points are now tagged, allowing them to be used
  to drive pre-fracture dynamics such as local surface buckling.
- Improved the performance of @vdblink::tree::Tree::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox()
  Tree::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::activeVoxelCount() Tree::activeVoxelCount@endlink,
  and significantly improved the performance of
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::evalLeafBoundingBox() Tree::evalLeafBoundingBox@endlink
  (by about&nbsp;30x).
- Added a tool (and a Houdini SOP) that fills a volume with
  adaptively-sized overlapping or non-overlapping spheres.
- Added a Ray SOP that can be used to perform geometry projections
  using level-set ray intersections or closest-point queries.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::ClosestSurfacePoint tool@endlink that performs
  accelerated closest surface point queries from arbitrary points in
  world space to narrow-band level sets.
- Increased the speed of masked level set filtering by 20% for
  the most common cases.
- Added @vdblink::math::BoxStencil math::BoxStencil@endlink, with support
  for trilinear interpolation and gradient computation.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::topologyIntersection()
  Tree::topologyIntersection@endlink, which intersects a tree&rsquo;s active
  values with those of another tree, and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::topologyDifference() Tree::topologyDifference@endlink,
  which performs topological subtraction of one tree&rsquo;s active values
  from another&rsquo;s.  In both cases, the <TT>ValueType</TT>s of the two
  trees need not be the same.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::activeTileCount() Tree::activeTileCount@endlink,
  which returns the number of active tiles in a tree.
- Added @vdblink::math::MinIndex() math::MinIndex@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::MaxIndex() math::MaxIndex@endlink, which find the minimum
  and maximum components of a vector without any branching.
- Added @vdblink::math::BBox::minExtent() BBox::minExtent@endlink,
  which returns a bounding box&rsquo;s shortest axis.
- The default @vdblink::math::BBox BBox@endlink constructor now
  generates an invalid bounding box rather than an empty bounding box
  positioned at the origin.  The new behavior is consistent with
  @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink.
  <I>[Thanks to Rick Hankins for suggesting this fix.]</I>
- Added @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::reset() CoordBBox::reset@endlink,
  which resets a bounding box to its initial, invalid state.
- Fixed a bug in the default @vdblink::math::ScaleMap ScaleMap@endlink
  constructor that left some data used in the inverse uninitialized.
- Added @vdblink::math::MapBase::applyJT MapBase::applyJT@endlink, which
  applies the Jacobian transpose to a vector (the Jacobian transpose takes
  a range-space vector to a domain-space vector, e.g., world to index),
  and added @vdblink::math::MapBase::inverseMap() MapBase::inverseMap@endlink,
  which returns a new map representing the inverse of the original map
  (except for @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink,
  which does not currently have a defined inverse map).
  <br>@b Note: Houdini 12.5 uses an earlier version of OpenVDB, and maps
  created with that version lack virtual table entries for these
  new methods, so do not call these methods from Houdini&nbsp;12.5.
- Reimplemented @vdblink::math::RandomInt math::RandomInt@endlink using
  Boost.Random instead of @c rand() (which is not thread-safe), and deprecated
  @c math::randUniform() and added
  @vdblink::math::Random01 math::Random01@endlink to replace it.
- Modified @vdblink::tools::copyFromDense() tools::copyFromDense@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::copyToDense() tools::copyToDense@endlink to allow
  for implicit type conversion (e.g., between a
  @vdblink::tools::Dense Dense&lt;Int32&gt;@endlink and a
  @vdblink::FloatTree FloatTree@endlink) and fixed several bugs
  in @vdblink::tools::CopyFromDense tools::CopyFromDense@endlink.
- Fixed bugs in @vdblink::math::Stats math::Stats@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Histogram math::Histogram@endlink that could produce
  <TT>NaN</TT>s or other incorrect behavior if certain methods were called
  on populations of size zero.
- Renamed <TT>struct tolerance</TT> to
  @vdblink::math::Tolerance math::Tolerance@endlink
  and @c negative to @vdblink::math::negative() math::negative@endlink
  and removed @c math::toleranceValue().
- Implemented a closest point on line segment algorithm,
  @vdblink::math::closestPointOnSegmentToPoint()
  math::closestPointOnSegmentToPoint@endlink.
- Fixed meshing issues relating to masking and automatic partitioning.
- @vdblink::Grid::merge() Grid::merge@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::merge() Tree::merge@endlink now accept an optional
  @vdblink::MergePolicy MergePolicy@endlink argument that specifies one of
  three new merging schemes.  (The old merging scheme, which is no longer
  available, used logic for each tree level that was inconsistent with
  the other levels and that could result in active tiles being replaced
  with nodes having only inactive values.)
- Renamed @c LeafNode::coord2offset(), @c LeafNode::offset2coord() and
  @c LeafNode::offset2globalCoord() to
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::coordToOffset() coordToOffset@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::offsetToLocalCoord() offsetToLocalCoord@endlink,
  and @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::offsetToGlobalCoord()
  offsetToGlobalCoord@endlink, respectively, and likewise for
  @vdblink::tree::InternalNode::offsetToGlobalCoord() InternalNode@endlink.
  <I>[Thanks to Rick Hankins for suggesting this change.]</I>
- Replaced @vdblink::tree::Tree Tree@endlink methods @c setValueOnMin,
  @c setValueOnMax and @c setValueOnSum with
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMin() tools::setValueOnMin@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMax() tools::setValueOnMax@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnSum() tools::setValueOnSum@endlink
  (and a new @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMult() tools::setValueOnMult@endlink)
  and added @vdblink::tree::Tree::modifyValue() Tree::modifyValue@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::Tree::modifyValueAndActiveState()
  Tree::modifyValueAndActiveState@endlink, which modify voxel values
  in-place via user-supplied functors.  Similarly, replaced
  @c ValueAccessor::setValueOnSum() with
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::modifyValue()
  ValueAccessor::modifyValue@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::modifyValueAndActiveState()
  ValueAccessor::modifyValueAndActiveState@endlink, and added a
  @vdblink::tree::TreeValueIteratorBase::modifyValue() modifyValue@endlink
  method to all value iterators.
- Removed @c LeafNode::addValue and @c LeafNode::scaleValue.
- Added convenience classes @vdblink::tree::Tree3 tree::Tree3@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree5 tree::Tree5@endlink for custom tree configurations.
- Added an option to the From Particles SOP to generate an alpha mask,
  which can be used to constrain level set filtering so as to preserve
  surface details.
- The mesh to volume converter now handles point-degenerate polygons.
- Fixed a bug in the Level Set Smooth, Level Set Renormalize and
  Level Set Offset SOPs that caused the group name to be ignored.
- Fixed various OS X and Windows build issues.

@htmlonly <a name="v1_2_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.2.0</B> - <I>June 28 2013</I>
- @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter Level set filters@endlink now accept
  an optional alpha mask grid.
- Implemented sharp feature extraction for level set surfacing.
  This enhances the quality of the output mesh and reduces aliasing
  artifacts.
- Added masking options to the meshing tools, as well as a spatial
  multiplier for the adaptivity threshold, automatic partitioning,
  and the ability to preserve edges and corners when mesh adaptivity
  is applied.
- The mesh to volume attribute transfer scheme now takes surface
  orientation into account, which improves accuracy in proximity to
  edges and corners.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::foreach() foreach@endlink method
  to @vdblink::tree::LeafManager tree::LeafManager@endlink that, like
  @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink, applies a user-supplied
  functor to each leaf node in parallel.
- Rewrote the particle to level set converter, simplifying the API,
  improving performance (especially when particles have a fixed radius),
  adding the capability to transfer arbitrary point attributes,
  and fixing a velocity trail bug.
- Added utility methods @vdblink::math::Sign() Sign@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::SignChange() SignChange@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::isApproxZero() isApproxZero@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::Cbrt() Cbrt@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::ZeroCrossing() ZeroCrossing@endlink to math/Math.h.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor3::probeNode() probeNode@endlink method
  to the value accessor and to tree nodes that returns a pointer to the node
  that contains a given voxel.
- Deprecated @c LeafNode::addValue and @c LeafNode::scaleValue.
- Doubled the speed of the mesh to volume converter (which also improves
  the performance of the fracture and level set rebuild tools) and
  improved its inside/outside voxel classification near edges and corners.
- @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink now accepts either a grid,
  a tree or a value accessor, and it offers faster index-based access methods
  and much better performance in cases where many instances are allocated.
- Extended @vdblink::tools::Dense tools::Dense@endlink to make it more
  compatible with existing tools.
- Fixed a crash in @vdblink::io::Archive io::Archive@endlink whenever
  the library was unloaded from memory and then reloaded.
  <I>[Contributed by Ollie Harding]</I>
- Fixed a bug in @c GU_PrimVDB::buildFromPrimVolume(), seen during the
  conversion from Houdini volumes to OpenVDB grids, that could cause
  signed flood fill to be applied to non-level set grids, resulting in
  active tiles with incorrect values.
- Added a Prune SOP with several pruning schemes.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_1_1_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.1.1</B> - <I>May 10 2013</I>
- Added a simple @vdblink::tools::Dense dense grid class@endlink and tools
  to copy data from dense voxel arrays into OpenVDB grids and vice-versa.
- Starting with Houdini 12.5.396, plugins built with this version
  of OpenVDB can coexist with native Houdini OpenVDB nodes.
- The level set fracture tool now smooths seam line edges during
  mesh extraction, eliminating staircase artifacts.
- Significantly improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::util::leafTopologyIntersection()
  leafTopologyIntersection@endlink and
  @vdblink::util::leafTopologyDifference() leafTopologyDifference@endlink
  utilities and added a @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::topologyDifference()
  LeafNode::topologyDifference@endlink method.
- Added convenience functions that provide simplified interfaces
  to the @vdblink::tools::meshToLevelSet() mesh to volume@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::volumeToMesh() volume to mesh@endlink converters.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::accumulate() tools::accumulate@endlink function
  that is similar to @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink
  but can be used to accumulate the results of computations over the values
  of a grid.
- Added @vdblink::tools::statistics() tools::statistics@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::opStatistics() tools::opStatistics@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::histogram() tools::histogram@endlink, which efficiently
  compute statistics (mean, variance, etc.) and histograms of grid values
  (using @vdblink::math::Stats math::Stats@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Histogram math::Histogram@endlink).
- Modified @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink to adhere to
  TBB&rsquo;s splittable type requirements, so that, for example,
  a @c CoordBBox can be used as a blocked iteration range.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::addTile() Tree::addTile@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::addLeaf() Tree::addLeaf@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::stealNode() Tree::stealNode@endlink, for fine
  control over tree construction.
- Addressed a numerical stability issue when performing Gaussian
  filtering of level set grids.
- Changed the return type of @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::volume()
  CoordBBox::volume@endlink to reduce the risk of overflow.
- When the input mesh is self-intersecting, the mesh to volume converter
  now produces a level set with a monotonic gradient field.
- Fixed a threading bug in the mesh to volume converter that caused it
  to produce different results for the same input.
- Fixed a bug in the particle to level set converter that prevented
  particles with zero velocity from being rasterized in Trail mode.
- Added an optional input to the Create SOP into which to merge
  newly-created grids.
- Fixed a bug in the Resample SOP that caused it to produce incorrect
  narrow-band widths when resampling level set grids.
- Fixed a bug in the To Polygons SOP that caused intermittent crashes
  when the optional reference input was connected.
- Fixed a bug in the Advect Level Set SOP that caused a crash
  when the velocity input was connected but empty.
- The Scatter and Sample Point SOPs now warn instead of erroring
  when given empty grids.
- Fixed a crash in @c vdb_view when stepping through multiple grids
  after changing render modes.
- @c vdb_view can now render fog volumes and vector fields, and it now
  features interactively adjustable clipping planes that enable
  one to view the interior of a volume.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_1_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.1.0</B> - <I>April 4 2013</I>
- The @vdblink::tools::resampleToMatch() resampleToMatch@endlink tool,
  the Resample SOP and the Combine SOP now use level set rebuild to correctly
  and safely resample level sets.  Previously, scaling a level set would
  invalidate the signed distance field, leading to holes and other artifacts.
- Added a mask-based topological
  @vdblink::tools::erodeVoxels erosion tool@endlink, and rewrote and
  simplified the @vdblink::tools::dilateVoxels dilation tool@endlink.
- The @vdblink::tools::LevelSetAdvection LevelSetAdvection@endlink tool
  can now advect forward or backward in time.
- Tree::pruneLevelSet() now replaces each pruned node with a tile having
  the inside or outside
  background value, instead of arbitrarily selecting one of the node&rsquo;s
  tile or voxel values.
- When a grid is saved to a file with
  @vdblink::Grid::saveFloatAsHalf() saveFloatAsHalf@endlink set to @c true,
  the grid&rsquo;s background value is now also quantized to 16 bits.
  (Not quantizing the background value caused a mismatch with the values
  of background tiles.)
- As with @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink, it is now
  possible to specify whether functors passed to
  @vdblink::tools::transformValues() tools::transformValues@endlink
  should be shared across threads.
- @vdblink::tree::LeafManager tree::LeafManager@endlink can now be
  instantiated with a @const tree, although buffer swapping with @const trees
  is disabled.
- Added a @vdblink::Grid::signedFloodFill() Grid::signedFloodFill@endlink
  overload that allows one to specify inside and outside values.
- Fixed a bug in Grid::setBackground() so that now only the values of
  inactive voxels change.
- Fixed @vdblink::Grid::topologyUnion() Grid::topologyUnion@endlink so that
  it actually unions tree topology, instead of just the active states
  of tiles and voxels.  The previous behavior broke multithreaded code
  that relied on input and output grids having compatible tree topology.
- @vdblink::math::Transform math::Transform@endlink now includes an
  @vdblink::math::Transform::isIdentity() isIdentity@endlink predicate
  and methods to @vdblink::math::Transform::preMult(const Mat4d&) pre-@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::Transform::postMult(const Mat4d&) postmultiply@endlink
  by a matrix.
- Modified the @link NodeMasks.h node mask@endlink classes to permit
  octree-like tree configurations (i.e., with a branching factor of two)
  and to use 64-bit operations instead of 32-bit operations.
- Implemented a new, more efficient
  @vdblink::math::closestPointOnTriangleToPoint() closest point
  on triangle@endlink algorithm.
- Implemented a new vertex normal scheme in the volume to mesh
  converter, and resolved some overlapping polygon issues.
- The volume to mesh converter now meshes not just active voxels
  but also active tiles.
- Fixed a bug in the mesh to volume converter that caused unsigned
  distance field conversion to produce empty grids.
- Fixed a bug in the level set fracture tool whereby the cutter overlap
  toggle was ignored.
- Fixed an infinite loop bug in @c vdb_view.
- Updated @c vdb_view to use the faster and less memory-intensive
  OpenVDB volume to mesh converter instead of marching cubes,
  and rewrote the shader to be OpenGL 3.2 and GLSL 1.2 compatible.
- Given multiple input files or a file containing multiple grids,
  @c vdb_view now displays one grid at a time.  The left and right
  arrow keys cycle between grids.
- The To Polygons SOP now has an option to associate the input grid&rsquo;s
  name with each output polygon.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_0_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.0.0</B> - <I>March 14 2013</I>
- @vdblink::tools::levelSetRebuild() tools::levelSetRebuild@endlink
  now throws an exception when given a non-scalar or non-floating-point grid.
- The tools in tools/GridOperators.h are now interruptible, as is
  the Analysis SOP.
- Added a
  @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::LeafRange::Iterator leaf node iterator@endlink
  and a TBB-compatible
  @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::LeafRange range class@endlink
  to the LeafManager.
- Modified the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh VolumeToMesh@endlink tool
  to handle surface topology issues around fracture seam lines.
- Modified the Makefile to allow @c vdb_view to compile on OS X systems
  (provided that GLFW is available).
- Fixed a bug in the Create SOP that resulted in "invalid parameter name"
  warnings.
- The Combine SOP now optionally resamples the A grid into the B grid&rsquo;s
  index space (or vice-versa) if the A and B transforms differ.
- The Vector Split and Vector Merge SOPs now skip inactive voxels
  by default, but they can optionally be made to include inactive voxels,
  as they did before.
- The @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFracture LevelSetFracture@endlink tool now
  supports custom rotations for each cutter instance, and the Fracture SOP
  now uses quaternions to generate uniformly-distributed random rotations.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_104_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.104.0</B> - <I>February 15 2013</I>
- Added a @vdblink::tools::levelSetRebuild() tool@endlink and a SOP
  to rebuild a level set from any scalar volume.
- @c .vdb files are now saved using a mask-based compression scheme
  that is an order of magnitude faster than ZLIB and produces comparable
  file sizes for level set and fog volume grids.  (ZLIB compression
  is still enabled by default for other classes of grids).
- The @vdblink::tools::Filter Filter@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter LevelSetFilter@endlink tools now
  include a Gaussian filter, and mean (box) filtering is now 10-50x faster.
- The isosurface @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh meshing tool@endlink
  is now more robust (to level sets with one voxel wide narrow bands,
  for example).
- Mesh to volume conversion is on average 1.5x faster and up to 5.5x
  faster for high-resolution meshes where the polygon/voxel size ratio
  is small.
- Added @vdblink::createLevelSet() createLevelSet@endlink and
  @vdblink::createLevelSetSphere() createLevelSetSphere@endlink
  factory functions for level set grids.
- @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor tree::ValueAccessor@endlink is now faster
  for trees of height 2, 3 and 4 (the latter is the default), and it now
  allows one to specify, via a template argument, the number of node levels
  to be cached, which can also improve performance in special cases.
- Added a toggle to @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink
  to specify whether or not the functor should be shared across threads.
- Added @vdblink::Mat4SMetadata Mat4s@endlink and
  @vdblink::Mat4DMetadata Mat4d@endlink metadata types.
- Added explicit pre- and postmultiplication methods to the @c Transform,
  @c Map and @c Mat4 classes and deprecated the old accumulation methods.
- Modified @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink
  to be more compatible with Houdini&rsquo;s frustum transform.
- Fixed a @vdblink::tools::GridTransformer GridTransformer@endlink bug
  that caused it to translate the output grid incorrectly in some cases.
- Fixed a bug in the tree-level
  @vdblink::tree::LeafIteratorBase LeafIterator@endlink that resulted in
  intermittent crashes in

  and of level set @vdblink::tools::csgUnion() CSG@endlink operations.
- Reintroduced Tree::pruneLevelSet(), a specialized Tree::pruneInactive()
  for level-set grids.
- Added utilities to the @c houdini_utils library to facilitate the
  collection of a chain of adjacent nodes of a particular type
  so that they can be cooked in a single step.  (For example,
  adjacent @c xform SOPs could be collapsed by composing their
  transformation matrices into a single matrix.)
- Added pruning and flood-filling options to the Convert SOP.
- Reimplemented the Filter SOP, omitting level-set-specific filters
  and adding node chaining (to reduce memory usage when applying
  several filters in sequence).
- Added a toggle to the Read SOP to read grid metadata and
  transforms only.
- Changed the attribute transfer scheme on the From Mesh and
  From Particles SOPs to allow for custom grid names and
  vector type metadata.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_99_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly

  for details about this important API change.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>

  off-by-one bugs related to bounding box dimensions.
- Fixed an off-by-one bug in @vdblink::Grid::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox()
  evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox@endlink.
- Introduced the @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink class,
  which will eventually replace the @c LeafArray class.  @c LeafManager supports
  dynamic buffers stored as a structure of arrays (SOA), unlike @c LeafArray,
  which supports only static buffers stored as an array of structures (AOS).
- Improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter LevelSetFilter@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker LevelSetTracker@endlink tools by rewriting
  them to use the new @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink class.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::setValueOnly() Tree::setValueOnly@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::setValueOnly()
  ValueAccessor::setValueOnly@endlink methods, which change the value of
  a voxel without changing its active state, and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::probeLeaf() Tree::probeLeaf@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::probeLeaf() ValueAccessor::probeLeaf@endlink
  methods that return the leaf node that contains a given voxel (unless
  the voxel is represented by a tile).
- Added a @vdblink::tools::LevelSetAdvection LevelSetAdvection@endlink tool
  that propagates and tracks narrow-band level sets.
- Introduced a new @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink class
  that supports world-space (or index-space) sampling of grid values.
- Changed the interpretation of the
  @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink&rsquo;s
  @em taper parameter to be the ratio of the near and far plane depths.
- Added a @c ParmFactory::setChoiceList() overload that accepts
  (@em token, @em label) string pairs, and a @c setDefault() overload that
  accepts an STL string.
- Fixed a crash in the Combine SOP in Copy B mode.
- Split the Level Set Filter SOP into three separate SOPs,
  Level Set Smooth, Level Set Reshape and Level Set Renormalize.
  When two or more of these nodes are connected in sequence, they interact
  to reduce memory usage: the last node in the sequence performs
  all of the operations in one step.
- The Advect Points SOP can now output polyline streamlines
  that trace the paths of the points.
- Added an option to the Analysis SOP to specify names for output grids.
- Added camera-derived frustum transform support to the Create SOP.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_97_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.97.0</B> - <I>October 18 2012</I>
- Added a narrow-band @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker level set
  interface tracking tool@endlink (up to fifth-order in space but currently
  only first-order in time, with higher temporal orders to be added soon).
- Added a @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter level set filter tool@endlink
  to perform unrestricted surface smoothing (e.g., Laplacian flow),
  filtering (e.g., mean value) and morphological operations (e.g.,
  morphological opening).
- Added adaptivity to the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh
  level set meshing tool@endlink for faster mesh extraction with fewer
  polygons, without postprocessing.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::touchLeaf()
  ValueAccessor::touchLeaf@endlink method that creates (if necessary)
  and returns the leaf node containing a given voxel.  It can be used
  to preallocate leaf nodes over which to run parallel algorithms.
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::Grid::merge() Grid::merge@endlink whereby
  active tiles were sometimes lost.
- Added @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink, which is similar
  to @c LeafArray but supports a dynamic buffer count and allocates buffers
  more efficiently.  Useful for temporal integration (e.g., for level set
  propagation and interface tracking), @c LeafManager is meant to replace
  @c LeafArray, which will be deprecated in the next release.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::fill() LeafNode::fill@endlink method
  to efficiently populate leaf nodes with constant values.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::visitActiveBBox() Tree::visitActiveBBox@endlink
  method that applies a functor to the bounding boxes of all active tiles
  and leaf nodes and that can be used to improve the performance of
  ray intersection tests, rendering of bounding boxes, etc.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::voxelizeActiveTiles()
  Tree::voxelizeActiveTiles@endlink method to densify active tiles.
  While convenient and fast, this can produce large dense grids, so use
  it with caution.
- Repackaged @c Tree::pruneLevelSet() as a Tree::pruneOp()-compatible
  functor.  Tree::LevelSetPrune is a specialized Tree::pruneInactive
  for level-set grids and is used in interface tracking.
- Added a GridBase::pruneGrid() method.
- Added a @vdblink::Grid::hasUniformVoxels() Grid:hasUniformVoxels@endlink
  method.
- Renamed @c tools::dilate to
  @vdblink::tools::dilateVoxels() dilateVoxels@endlink and improved its
  performance.  The new name reflects the fact that the current
  implementation ignores active tiles.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::resampleToMatch() tools::resampleToMatch@endlink
  function that resamples an input grid into an output grid with a
  different transform such that, after resampling, the input and output grids
  coincide, but the output grid&rsquo;s transform is preserved.
- Significantly improved the performance of depth-bounded value
  iterators (@vdblink::tree::Tree::ValueOnIter ValueOnIter@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::ValueAllIter ValueAllIter@endlink, etc.)
  when the depth bound excludes leaf nodes.
- Exposed the value buffers inside leaf nodes with
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::buffer() LeafNode::buffer@endlink.
  This allows for very fast access (const and non-const) to voxel
  values using linear array offsets instead of @ijk coordinates.
- In openvdb_houdini/UT_VDBTools.h, added operators for use with
  @c processTypedGrid that resample grids in several different ways.
- Added a policy mechanism to @c houdini_utils::OpFactory that allows for
  customization of operator names, icons, and Help URLs.
- Renamed many of the Houdini SOPs to make the names more consistent.
- Added an Advect Points SOP.
- Added a Level Set Filter SOP that allows for unrestricted surface
  deformations, unlike the older Filter SOP, which restricts surface
  motion to the initial narrow band.
- Added staggered vector sampling to the Sample Points SOP.
- Added a minimum radius threshold to the particle voxelization tool
  and SOP.
- Merged the Composite and CSG SOPs into a single Combine SOP.
- Added a tool and a SOP to efficiently generate narrow-band level set
  representations of spheres.
- In the Visualize SOP, improved the performance of tree topology
  generation, which is now enabled by default.

  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::getValue(Index) const methods@endlink
  that index by linear offset (as returned by
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::ValueOnIter::pos() ValueIter::pos@endlink)

- Added a @link FiniteDifference.h library@endlink of index-space finite
  difference operators.
- Added a Hermite grid type that compactly
  stores each voxel&rsquo;s upwind normals and can be used to convert volumes
  to and from polygonal meshes.
- Added a @link PointScatter.h tool@endlink (and a Houdini SOP)
  to scatter points randomly throughout a volume.
