Atomic operations
=================

In Taichi, augmented assignments (e.g., ``x[i] += 1``) are automatically `atomic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch-and-add>`_.


.. warning::

    When modifying global variables in parallel, make sure you use atomic operations. For example, to sum up all the elements in ``x``,
    ::

        @ti.kernel
        def sum():
            for i in x:
                # Approach 1: OK
                total[None] += x[i]

                # Approach 2: OK
                ti.atomic_add(total[None], x[i])

                # Approach 3: Wrong result since the operation is not atomic.
                total[None] = total[None] + x[i]


.. note::
    When atomic operations are applied to local values, the Taichi compiler will try to demote these operations into their non-atomic counterparts.

Apart from the augmented assignments, explicit atomic operations, such as ``ti.atomic_add``, also do read-modify-write atomically.
These operations additionally return the **old value** of the first argument.

Below is a list of all explicit atomic operations:

.. function:: ti.atomic_add(x, y)
.. function:: ti.atomic_sub(x, y)

    Atomically compute ``x + y`` or ``x - y`` and store the result in ``x``.

    :return: The old value of ``x``.

    For example,
    ::

        x[i] = 3
        y[i] = 4
        z[i] = ti.atomic_add(x[i], y[i])
        # now x[i] = 7, y[i] = 4, z[i] = 3


.. function:: ti.atomic_and(x, y)
.. function:: ti.atomic_or(x, y)
.. function:: ti.atomic_xor(x, y)

    Atomically compute ``x & y`` (bitwise and), ``x | y`` (bitwise or), or ``x ^ y`` (bitwise xor), and store the result in ``x``.

    :return: The old value of ``x``.
