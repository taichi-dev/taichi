Hello, world!
=============

We introduce the Taichi programming language through a very basic `fractal` example.

Running the Taichi code below (``python3 fractal.py`` or ``ti example fractal``) will give you an animation of
`Julia set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    # fractal.py

    import taichi as ti

    ti.init(arch=ti.gpu)

    n = 320
    pixels = ti.var(dt=ti.f32, shape=(n * 2, n))


    @ti.func
    def complex_sqr(z):
        return ti.Vector([z[0]**2 - z[1]**2, z[1] * z[0] * 2])


    @ti.kernel
    def paint(t: ti.f32):
        for i, j in pixels:  # Parallized over all pixels
            c = ti.Vector([-0.8, ti.cos(t) * 0.2])
            z = ti.Vector([i / n - 1, j / n - 0.5]) * 2
            iterations = 0
            while z.norm() < 20 and iterations < 50:
                z = complex_sqr(z) + c
                iterations += 1
            pixels[i, j] = 1 - iterations * 0.02


    gui = ti.GUI("Julia Set", res=(n * 2, n))

    for i in range(1000000):
        paint(i * 0.03)
        gui.set_image(pixels)
        gui.show()

Let's dive into this simple Taichi program.

import taichi as ti
-------------------
Taichi is a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Python. To make Taichi as easy to use as a Python package,
we have done heavy engineering with this goal in mind - letting every Python programmer write Taichi programs with
minimal learning effort. You can even use your favorite Python package management system, Python IDEs and other
Python packages in conjunction with Taichi.

Portability
-----------

Taichi programs run on either CPUs or GPUs. Initialize Taichi according to your hardware platform as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  # Run on GPU, automatically detect backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.gpu)

  # Run on GPU, with the NVIDIA CUDA backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.cuda)
  # Run on GPU, with the OpenGL backend
  ti.init(arch=ti.opengl)
  # Run on GPU, with the Apple Metal backend, if you are on OS X
  ti.init(arch=ti.metal)

  # Run on CPU (default)
  ti.init(arch=ti.cpu)

.. note::
    Supported backends on different platforms:

    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | platform | CPU  | CUDA | OpenGL | Metal |
    +==========+======+======+========+=======+
    | Windows  | OK   | OK   | OK     | N/A   |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | Linux    | OK   | OK   | OK     | N/A   |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+
    | Mac OS X | OK   | N/A  | N/A    | OK    |
    +----------+------+------+--------+-------+

    (OK: supported; N/A: not available)

    With ``arch=ti.gpu``, Taichi will first try to run with CUDA.
    If CUDA is not supported on your machine, Taichi will fall back on Metal or OpenGL.
    If no GPU backend (CUDA, Metal, or OpenGL) is supported, Taichi will fall back on CPUs.

.. note::

  When used with the CUDA backend on Windows or ARM devices (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson),
  Taichi by default allocates 1 GB GPU memory for tensor storage. You can override this behavior by initializing with
  ``ti.init(arch=ti.cuda, device_memory_GB=3.4)`` to allocate ``3.4`` GB GPU memory, or
  ``ti.init(arch=ti.cuda, device_memory_fraction=0.3)`` to allocate ``30%`` of the total GPU memory.

  On other platforms, Taichi will make use of its on-demand memory allocator to adaptively allocate memory.

(Sparse) tensors
----------------

Taichi is a data-oriented programming language where dense or spatially-sparse tensors are the first-class citizens.
See :ref:`sparse` for more details on sparse tensors.

In the code above, ``pixels = ti.var(dt=ti.f32, shape=(n * 2, n))`` allocates a 2D dense tensor named ``pixels`` of
size ``(640, 320)`` and element data type ``ti.f32`` (i.e. ``float`` in C).

Functions and kernels
---------------------

Computation resides in Taichi **kernels**. Kernel arguments must be type-hinted.
The language used in Taichi kernels and functions looks exactly like Python, yet the Taichi frontend compiler converts it
into a language that is **compiled, statically-typed, lexically-scoped, parallel and differentiable**.

Taichi **functions**, which can be called by Taichi kernels and other Taichi functions, should be defined with the keyword ``ti.func``.

.. note::

  **Taichi-scopes v.s. Python-scopes**: everything decorated with ``ti.kernel`` and ``ti.func`` is in Taichi-scope, which will be compiled by the Taichi compiler.
  Everything else is in Python-scopes. They are simply Python code.

.. warning::

  Taichi kernels must be called in the Python-scope. I.e., **nested kernels are not supported**.
  Nested functions are allowed. **Recursive functions are not supported for now**.

  Taichi functions can only be called in Taichi-scope.

For those who come from the world of CUDA, ``ti.func`` corresponds to ``__device__`` while ``ti.kernel`` corresponds to ``__global__``.


Parallel for-loops
------------------
For loops at the outermost scope in a Taichi kernel is **automatically parallelized**.
For loops can have two forms, i.e. `range-for loops` and `struct-for loops`.

**Range-for loops** are no different from Python for loops, except that it will be parallelized
when used at the outermost scope. Range-for loops can be nested.

.. code-block:: python

  @ti.kernel
  def fill():
      for i in range(10): # Parallelized
          x[i] += i

          s = 0
          for j in range(5): # Serialized in each parallel thread
              s += j

          y[i] = s

  @ti.kernel
  def fill_3d():
      # Parallelized for all 3 <= i < 8, 1 <= j < 6, 0 <= k < 9
      for i, j, k in ti.ndrange((3, 8), (1, 6), 9):
          x[i, j, k] = i + j + k

.. note::

    It is the loop **at the outermost scope** that gets parallelized, not the outermost loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        @ti.kernel
        def foo():
            for i in range(10): # Parallelized :-)
                ...

        @ti.kernel
        def bar(k: ti.i32):
            if k > 42:
                for i in range(10): # Serial :-(
                    ...

**Struct-for loops** are particularly useful when iterating over (sparse) tensor elements.
In the code above, ``for i, j in pixels`` loops over all the pixel coordinates, i.e. ``(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), ... , (0, 319), (1, 0), ..., (639, 319)``.

.. note::

    Struct-for is the key to :ref:`sparse` in Taichi, as it will only loop over active elements in a sparse tensor. In dense tensors, all elements are active.

.. warning::

    Struct-for loops must live at the outer-most scope of kernels.

    It is the loop **at the outermost scope** that gets parallelized, not the outermost loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        @ti.kernel
        def foo():
            for i in x:
                ...

        @ti.kernel
        def bar(k: ti.i32):
            # The outermost scope is a `if` statement
            if k > 42:
                for i in x: # Not allowed. Struct-fors must live in the outermost scope.
                    ...




.. warning::

    ``break`` **is not supported in parallel loops**:

    .. code-block:: python

      @ti.kernel
      def foo():
        for i in x:
            ...
            break # Error!

        for i in range(10):
            ...
            break # Error!

      @ti.kernel
      def foo():
        for i in x:
            for j in range(10):
                ...
                break # OK!


Interacting with Python
------------------------

Everything outside Taichi-scopes (``ti.func`` and ``ti.kernel``) is simply Python code.
In Python-scopes, you can access Taichi tensor elements using plain indexing syntax. For example,
to access a single pixel of the rendered image in Python, simply use

.. code-block:: python

  pixels[42, 11] = 0.7
  print(pixels[42, 11]) # prints 0.7


You can also use your favorite Python packages (e.g. ``numpy``, ``pytorch``, ``matplotlib``) together with Taichi.
Taichi provides helper functions such as ``from_numpy`` and ``to_torch`` for tensor format conversion:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    pixels.from_numpy(np.random.rand(n * 2, n))

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.imshow(pixels.to_numpy())
    plt.show()

See :ref:`external` for more details.
