# Installation Troubleshooting

### Linux issues

- If Taichi crashes and reports `libtinfo.so.5 not found`:

  - On Ubuntu, execute `sudo apt install libtinfo-dev`.

  - On Arch Linux, first edit `/etc/pacman.conf`, and append these
    lines:

    ```
    [archlinuxcn]
    Server = https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/archlinuxcn/$arch
    ```

    Then execute `sudo pacman -Syy ncurses5-compat-libs`.

- If Taichi crashes and reports
  `` /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.11' not found ``:

  You might be using Ubuntu 16.04. Please try the solution in [this
  thread](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/819#issuecomment-377776784):

  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
  ```


### Windows issues

- If Taichi crashes and reports `ImportError` on Windows. Please
  consider installing [Microsoft Visual C++
  Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Python issues

- If `pip` could not find a satisfying package,
  i.e.,

  ```
  ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement taichi (from versions: none)
  ERROR: No matching distribution found for taichi
  ```

  - Make sure you're using Python version 3.6/3.7/3.8:

    ```bash
    python3 -c "print(__import__('sys').version[:3])"
    # 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
    ```

  - Make sure your Python executable is 64-bit:

    ```bash
    python3 -c "print(__import__('platform').architecture()[0])"
    # 64bit
    ```

### CUDA issues

- If Taichi crashes with the following errors:

  ```
  [Taichi] mode=release
  [Taichi] version 0.6.0, supported archs: [cpu, cuda, opengl], commit 14094f25, python 3.8.2
  [W 05/14/20 10:46:49.549] [cuda_driver.h:call_with_warning@60] CUDA Error CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE: invalid device ordinal while calling mem_advise (cuMemAdvise)
  [E 05/14/20 10:46:49.911] Received signal 7 (Bus error)
  ```

  This might be because that your NVIDIA GPU is pre-Pascal and it
  has limited support for [Unified
  Memory](https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/01/24/unified-memory-the-final-piece-of-the-gpu-programming-puzzle/).

  - **Possible solution**: add `export TI_USE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=0` to
    your `~/.bashrc`. This disables unified memory usage in the CUDA
    backend.


- If Taichi exits with message "Out of CUDA pre-allocated memory", e.g.,

  ```python
  import taichi as ti

  ti.init(arch=ti.cuda)

  x = ti.field(dtype=ti.i16)

  ti.root.pointer(ti.i, 1024).dense(ti.i, 1024 * 1024).place(x)
  # A sparse array. Each dense block is 2MB in size.

  # Populate 1024 * 2MB = 2GB memory
  def populate():
    for k in range(1024):
      x[k * 1024 * 1024] = 1

  populate()
  ```

  ... may give you ...

  ```
  [Taichi] Starting on arch=cuda
  Taichi JIT:0: allocate_from_buffer: block: [0,0,0], thread: [0,0,0] Assertion `Out of CUDA pre-allocated memory.
  Consider using ti.init(device_memory_fraction=0.9) or ti.init(device_memory_GB=4) to allocate more GPU memory` failed.
  ```

  This usually happens when you are using sparse data structures that need dynamic GPU memory allocation.
  On platforms without CUDA unified memory support (e.g., Windows),
  Taichi only pre-allocates 1 GB of GPU memory for dynamically allocated data structures.
  To fix this, simply pre-allocate more GPU memory:

    1. Set `ti.init(..., device_memory_fraction=0.9)` to allocate 90% of GPU memory. Replace "90%" with any other fraction depending on your hardware.
    2. Set `ti.init(..., device_memory_GB=4)` to allocate 4 GB GPU memory. Feel free to use any number bigger than 1.
    3. Setting environment variables `TI_DEVICE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.9` and `TI_DEVICE_MEMORY_GB=4` would also work.

  Note that on Linux, Taichi automatically grows the memory pool using CUDA unified memory mechanisms.

- If you find other CUDA problems:

  - **Possible solution**: add `export TI_ENABLE_CUDA=0` to your
    `~/.bashrc`. This disables the CUDA backend completely and
    Taichi will fall back on other GPU backends such as OpenGL.

### OpenGL issues

- If Taichi crashes with a stack backtrace containing a line of
  `glfwCreateWindow` (see
  [\#958](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues/958)):

  ```{9-11}
  [Taichi] mode=release
  [E 05/12/20 18.25:00.129] Received signal 11 (Segmentation Fault)
  ***********************************
  * Taichi Compiler Stack Traceback *
  ***********************************

  ... (many lines, omitted)

  /lib/python3.8/site-packages/taichi/core/../lib/taichi_core.so: _glfwPlatformCreateWindow
  /lib/python3.8/site-packages/taichi/core/../lib/taichi_core.so: glfwCreateWindow
  /lib/python3.8/site-packages/taichi/core/../lib/taichi_core.so: taichi::lang::opengl::initialize_opengl(bool)

  ... (many lines, omitted)
  ```

  it is likely because you are running Taichi on a (virtual) machine
  with an old OpenGL API. Taichi requires OpenGL 4.3+ to work.

  - **Possible solution**: add `export TI_ENABLE_OPENGL=0` to your
    `~/.bashrc` even if you initialize Taichi with other backends
    than OpenGL. This disables the OpenGL backend detection to avoid
    incompatibilities.



### Other issues

- If none of those above address your problem, please report this by
  [opening an
  issue](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues/new?labels=potential+bug&template=bug_report.md)
  on GitHub. This would help us improve user experiences and
  compatibility, many thanks!
