Why new programming language
============================

Taichi is a high-performance programming language for computer graphics applications. The design goals are

- Productivity
- Performance
- Portability
- Spatially sparse computation
- Differentiable programming
- Metaprogramming

Design decisions
----------------

- Decouple computation from data structures
- Domain-specific compiler optimizations
- Megakernels
