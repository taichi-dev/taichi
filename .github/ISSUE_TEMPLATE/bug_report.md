<!-- We've collected some common issue solutions in https://taichi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#troubleshooting. Make sure you've check them out first. Hopefully they could address your problem. -->

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is, ideally within 20 words.

**To Reproduce**
Please post a sample code to reproduce the bug. The developer team will put a higher priority on bugs that can be reproduced within 20 lines of code. If you want a prompt reply, please keep the code short.

**Log/Screenshots**
Please post the full log of the program (instead of just a few lines around the error message, unless the log is > 1000 lines). This will help us diagnose what's happening.

**If you have local commits (e.g. compile fixes before you reproduce the bug), please make sure you first make a PR to fix the build errors and then report the bug.**
