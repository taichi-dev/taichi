## Updates
- (Feb  25, 2020) v0.5.3 released
   - Better error message when try to declare tensors after kernel invocation (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Logging: `ti.warning` renamed to `ti.warn`
   - Arch: `ti.x86_64` renamed to `ti.x64`. `ti.x86_64` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
   - (For developers) Improved runtime bit code compilation thread safety (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Improved OS X GUI performance (by **Ye Kuang [k-ye]**)
   - Experimental support for new integer types `u8, i8, u16, i16, u32` (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Update doc (by **Ye Kuang [k-ye]**)
- (Feb  20, 2020) v0.5.2 released
   - Gradients for `ti.pow` now supported (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Multi-threaded unit testing (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Fixed Taichi crashing when starting multiple instances simultaneously (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - Metal backend now supports `ti.pow` (by **Ye Kuang [k-ye]**)
   - Better algebraic simplification (by **Mingkuan Xu [xumingkuan]**)
   - `ti.normalized` now optionally takes a argument `eps` to prevent division by zero in differentiable programming
   - Improved random number generation by decorrelating PRNG streams on CUDA
   - Set environment variable `TI_LOG_LEVEL` to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` to filter out/increase verbosity. Default=`info`
   - [bug fix] fixed a loud failure on differentiable programming code generation due to a new optimization pass
   - Added `ti.GUI.triangle` [example](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/master/misc/test_gui.py#L11)
   - Doc update: added `ti.cross` for 3D cross products
   - Use environment variable `TI_TEST_THREADS` to override testing threads
   - [For Taichi developers, bug fix] `ti.init(print_processed=True)` renamed to `ti.init(print_preprocessed=True)`
   - Various development infrastructure improvements by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**
   - Official Python3.6 - Python3.8 packages on OS X (by **wYw [Detavern]**)
- (Feb  16, 2020) v0.5.1 released
   - Keyboard and mouse events supported in the GUI system. Check out [mpm128.py](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/4f5cc09ae0e35a47ad71fdc582c1ecd5202114d8/examples/mpm128.py) for a interactive demo! (by **Yubin Peng [archibate] and Ye Kuang [k-ye]**)
   - Basic algebraic simplification passes (by **Mingkuan Xu [xumingkuan]**)
   - (For developers) `ti` (`ti.exe`) command supported on Windows after setting `%PATH%` correctly (by **Mingkuan Xu [xumingkuan]**)
   - General power operator `x ** y` now supported in Taichi kernels (by **Yubin Peng [archibate]**)
   - `.dense(...).pointer()` now abbreviated as `.pointer(...)`. `pointer` now stands for a dense pointer array. This leads to cleaner code and better performance. (by **Kenneth Lozes [KLozes]**)
   - (Advanced struct-fors only) `for i in X` now iterates all child instances of `X` instead of `X` itself. Skip this if you only use `X=leaf node` such as `ti.f32/i32/Vector/Matrix`.
   - Fixed cuda random number generator racing conditions
- (Feb  14, 2020) **v0.5.0 released with a new Apple Metal GPU backend for Mac OS X users!** (by **Ye Kuang [k-ye]**)
   - Just initialize your program with `ti.init(..., arch=ti.metal)` and run Taichi on your Mac GPUs!
   - A few takeaways if you do want to use the Metal backend:
     - For now, the Metal backend only supports `dense` SNodes and 32-bit data types. It doesn't support `ti.random()` or `print()`.
     - Pre-2015 models may encounter some undefined behaviors under certain conditions (e.g. read-after-write). According to our tests, it seems like the memory order on a single GPU thread could go inconsistent on these models.
     - The `[]` operator in Python is slow in the current implementation. If you need to do a large number of reads, consider dumping all the data to a `numpy` array via `to_numpy()` as a workaround. For writes, consider first generating the data into a `numpy` array, then copying that to the Taichi variables as a whole.
     - Do NOT expect a performance boost yet, and we are still profiling and tuning the new backend. (So far we only saw a big performance improvement on a 2015 MBP 13-inch model.)

## Short-term goals
- (Done) Fully implement the LLVM backend to replace the legacy source-to-source C++/CUDA backends (By Dec 2019)
  - The only missing features compared to the old source-to-source backends:
    - Vectorization on CPUs. Given most users who want performance are using GPUs (CUDA), this is given low priority.
    - Automatic shared memory utilization. Postponed until Feb/March 2020.
- (Done) Redesign & reimplement (GPU) memory allocator (by the end of Jan 2020)
- (WIP) Tune the performance of the LLVM backend to match that of the legacy source-to-source backends (Hopefully by Feb, 2020. Current progress: setting up/tuning for final benchmarks)
