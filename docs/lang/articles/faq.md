# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does my `pip` complain `package not found` when installing Taichi?

You may have a Python interpreter with an unsupported version. Currently, Taichi only supports Python 3.6/3.7/3.8 (64-bit) . For more information about installation related issues, please check [Installation Troubleshooting](./misc/install.md).

### Does Taichi provide built-in constants such as `ti.pi`?

There is no built-in constant such as `pi`. We recommended using `math.pi` directly.

### Outer-most loops in Taichi kernels are by default parallel. How can I **serialize** one of them?

A solution is to add an additional *ghost* loop with only one iteration outside the loop you want to serialize.

```python {1}
for _ in range(1):  # This "ghost" loop will be "parallelized", but with only one thread. Therefore, the containing loop below is serialized.
    for i in range(100):  # The loop you want to serialize
        ...
```

### What is the most convenient way to load images into Taichi fields?

One feasible solution is `field.from_numpy(ti.imread('filename.png'))`.

### Can Taichi interact with **other Python packages** such as `matplotlib`?

Yes, Taichi supports various popular Python packages. Please check out [Interacting with other Python packages](/docs/#interacting-with-other-python-packages).

### How do I declare a field with a **dynamic length**?

The `dynamic` SNode supports variable-length fields. It acts similarly to `std::vector` in C++ or `list` in Python. Please check out [Working with dynamic SNodes](../api/snode.md#working-with-dynamic-snodes) for more details.

:::tip
An alternative solution is to allocate a large enough `dense` field, with a corresponding 0-D field
`field_len[None]` tracking its length. In practice, programs allocating memory using `dynamic`
SNodes may be less efficient than using `dense` SNodes, due to dynamic data structure
maintainance overheads.

### How do I program on less structured data structures (such as graphs and tetrahedral meshes) in Taichi?

These structures have to be decomposed into 1D Taichi fields. For example, when representing a graph, you can allocate two fields, one for the vertices and the other for the edges. You can then traverse the elements using `for v in vertices` or `for v in range(n)`.
