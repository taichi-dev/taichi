Command line utilities
======================

A successful installation of Taichi should add a CLI (Command-Line Interface) to your system,
which is helpful to perform several rountine tasks quickly. To invoke the CLI, please
run ``ti`` or ``python3 -m taichi``.

Examples
--------
Taichi provides a set of bundled examples.
You could run ``ti example -h`` to print the help message and get a list of available example names.
For instance, to run the basic ``fractal`` example, try: ``ti example fractal`` from your shell. (``ti example fractal.py`` should also work)

You may print the source code of example by running ``ti example -p fractal``, or ``ti example -P fractal`` for print with syntax highlight.

You may also save the example to current work directory by running ``ti example -s fractal``.

Changelog
---------
Sometimes it's convenient to view the changelog of the current version of Taichi.
To do so, you could run ``ti changelog`` in your shell.

REPL Shell
----------
Sometimes it's convenient to start a Python shell with ``import taichi as ti``
as a pre-loaded module for fast testing and confirmation.
To do so from your shell, you could run ``ti repl``.

System information
------------------
When you try to report potential bugs in an issue, please consider running ``ti diagnose`` and offer its output as an attachment.
This could help maintainers to learn more about the context and the system information of your environment to make the debugging process more efficient and solve your issue more easily. **Before posting it, please review and make sure there's no sensitive information about your data or yourself gets carried in.**

.. _cli_video_tools:

Converting PNGs to video
------------------------
Sometimes it's convenient to convert a series of ``png`` files into a single
video when showing your result to others.

For example, suppose you have ``000000.png``, ``000001.png``, ... generated according
to :ref:`export_results` in the **current working directory**.

Then you could run ``ti video`` to create a file ``video.mp4`` containing all
these images as frames (sorted by file name).

Use ``ti video -f40`` for creating a video with 40 FPS.

Converting video to GIF
-----------------------
Sometimes we need ``gif`` images in order to post the result on forums.

To do so, you could run ``ti gif -i video.mp4``, where ``video.mp4`` is the
``mp4`` video (generated with instructions above).

Use ``ti gif -i video.mp4 -f40`` for creating a GIF with 40 FPS.
